同志们： 
Comrades, 
现在，我代表第十八届中央委员会向大会作报告。 
On behalf of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, I will now deliver a report to the 19th National Congress. 
中国共产党第十九次全国代表大会，是在全面建成小康社会决胜阶段、中国特色社会主义进入新时代的关键时期召开的一次十分重要的大会。 
The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China is a meeting of great importance taking place during the decisive stage in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and at a critical moment as socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era. 
大会的主题是：不忘初心，牢记使命，高举中国特色社会主义伟大旗帜，决胜全面建成小康社会，夺取新时代中国特色社会主义伟大胜利，为实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦不懈奋斗。 
The theme of the Congress is: Remain true to our original aspiration and keep our mission firmly in mind, hold high the banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics, secure a decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects,strive for the great success of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, and work tirelessly to realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.
不忘初心，方得始终。中国共产党人的初心和使命，就是为中国人民谋幸福，为中华民族谋复兴。这个初心和使命是激励中国共产党人不断前进的根本动力。全党同志一定要永远与人民同呼吸、共命运、心连心，永远把人民对美好生活的向往作为奋斗目标，以永不懈怠的精神状态和一往无前的奋斗姿态，继续朝着实现中华民族伟大复兴的宏伟目标奋勇前进。
Never forget why you started, and you can accomplish your mission. The original aspiration and the mission of Chinese Communists is to seek happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation. This founding aspiration, this mission, is what inspires Chinese Communists to advance. In our Party, each and every one of us must always breathe the same breath as the people, share the same future, and stay truly connected to them. The aspirations of the people to live a better life must always be the focus of our efforts. We must keep on striving with endless energy toward the great goal of national rejuvenation. 
当前，国内外形势正在发生深刻复杂变化，我国发展仍处于重要战略机遇期，前景十分光明，挑战也十分严峻。全党同志一定要登高望远、居安思危，勇于变革、勇于创新，永不僵化、永不停滞，团结带领全国各族人民决胜全面建成小康社会，奋力夺取新时代中国特色社会主义伟大胜利。 
Both China and the world are in the midst of profound and complex changes. China is still in an important period of strategic opportunity for development; the prospects are bright but the challenges are severe. All comrades must aim high and look far, be alert to dangers even in times of calm, have the courage to pursue reformand break new ground, and never becomehardened to change or inactive. We will unite the Chinese people ofall ethnic groups and leadthemto a decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and in the drive to secure the success of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era. 
一、过去五年的工作和历史性变革 
The Past Five Years: Our Work and Historic Change 
十八大以来的五年，是党和国家发展进程中极不平凡的五年。面对世界经济复苏乏力、局部冲突和动荡频发、全球性问题加剧的外部环境，面对我国经济发展进入新常态等一系列深刻变化，我们坚持稳中求进工作总基调，迎难而上，开拓进取，取得了改革开放和社会主义现代化建设的历史性成就。 
The five years since the 18th National Congress have been a truly remarkable five years in the course of the development of the Party and the country. OutsideChina, we have been confronted with sluggish global economic recovery, frequent outbreaks of regional conflicts and disturbances, and intensifying global issues. At home, we have encountered profound changes as China has entered a new normal in economic development. We have upheld the underlying principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability, risen to challenges, pioneered and pushed ahead, and made historic achievements in reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. 
为贯彻十八大精神，党中央召开七次全会，分别就政府机构改革和职能转变、全面深化改革、全面推进依法治国、制定 “十三五”规划、全面从严治党等重大问题作出决定和部署。五年来，我们统筹推进 “五位一体”总体布局、协调推进 “四个全面”战略布局，“十二五”规划胜利完成，“十三五”规划顺利实施，党和国家事业全面开创新局面。 
To put the guiding principles from our 18th National Congress into action, the Party Central Committee has held seven plenary sessions. There, decisions and plans were made on issues of major importance, from reforming the institutions cind transforming the functions of government to deepening reformin all areas, advancing law-based governance, formulating the 13th Five-Year Plan, and seeing governance over the Party is exercised fully and with rigor. In the past five years, we have implemented the five-sphere integrated plan1 and the four-pronged comprehensive strategy, fulfilled the goals of the 12th Five-Year Plan, and made smooth progress in implementing the 13th Five-Year Plan. On all fronts new advances have been made for the cause of the Party and the country. 
经济建设取得重大成就。 
We have made major achievements in economic development. 
坚定不移贯彻新发展理念，坚决端正发展观念、转变发展方式，发展质量和效益不断提升。经济保持中高速增长，在世界主要国家中名列前茅，国内生产总值从五十四万亿元增长到八十万亿元，稳居世界第二，对世界经济增长贡献率超过百分之三十。供给侧结构性改革深入推进，经济结构不断优化，数字经济等新兴产业蓬勃发展，高铁、公路、桥梁、港口、机场等基础设施建设快速推进。农业现代化稳步推进，粮食生产能力达到一万二千亿斤。城镇化率年均提高一点二个百分点，八千多万农业转移人口成为城镇居民。区域发展协调性增强， “一带一路”建设、京津冀协同发展、长江经济带发展成效显著。创新驱动发展战略大力实施，创新型国家建设成果丰硕，天宫、蛟龙、天眼、悟空、墨子、大飞机等重大科技成果相继问世。南海岛礁建设积极推进。开放型经济新体制逐步健全，对外贸易、对外投资、外汇储备稳居世界前列。 
We have remained committed to the new development philosophy, adopted the right approach to development, and endeavored to transform the growth model. The result has been a constant improvement in the quality and effect of development. The economy has maintained a medium-high growth rate, making China a leader among the major economies. With the gross domestic product rising from 54 trillion to 80 trillion yuan, China has maintained its position as the world’s second largest economy and contributed more than 30 percent of global economic growth. Supply-side structural reform has made further headway, bringing a steady improvementin the economic structure. Emerging industries like the digital economy are thriving; the construction of high-speed railways, highways, bridges, ports, airports, and other types of infrastructure has picked up pace. Agricultural modernization has steadily advanced, with annual grain production reaching 600 million metric tons. The level of urbanization has risen by an annual average of 1.2 percentage points, and more than 80 million people who have moved from rural to urban areas have gained permanent urban residency. Regional development has become more balanced; the Belt and Road Initiative, the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, and the development of the Yangtze Economic Belt have all made notable progress.Through devoting great energy to implementing the innovation-driven development strategy, wehave seen much accomplished toward making China a country of innovators, with major advances made in science and technology, including the successful launch of Tiangong-2 space lab, the commissioning of the deep-sea manned submersible Jiaolong and of the five-hundred-meter aperture spherical telescope (FAST) Tianyan, the launch of the dark matter probe satellite Wukong and the quantumscience satellite Mozi, and the test flight of the airliner C919. Construction on islands and reefs in the South China Sea has seen steady progress. Thenew institutions ofthe open economy have been steadily improved. China now leads the world in trade, outbound investment, and foreign exchange reserves. 
全面深化改革取得重大突破。 
We have made major breakthroughs in deepening reform. 
蹄疾步稳推进全面深化改革，坚决破除各方面体制机制弊端。改革全面发力、多点突破、纵深推进，着力增强改革系统性、整体性、协同性，压茬拓展改革广度和深度，推出一千五百多项改革举措，重要领域和关键环节改革取得突破性进展，主要领域改革主体框架基本确立。中国特色社会主义制度更加完善，国家治理体系和治理能力现代化水平明显提高，全社会发展活力和创新活力明显增强。

We have pursued reformin amore systematic, holistic, and coordinated way, increasing its coverage and depth. Thanks to the launch of over 1,500 reform measures, breakthroughs have been madein key areas, and general frameworks for reformhave been established inmajor fields.The systemof socialismwith Chinese characteristics has been further improved, with notable progress made in modernizing China’s system and capacity for governance.

We have actively developed socialist democracy and advanced law-based governance. We have stepped up institution building across the board to make integrated advances in Party leadership, the people running the country, and law-based governance; and we have continuously improved the institutions and mechanisms by which the Party exercises leadership. Steady progress has been made in enhancing socialist democracy; intrapartydemocracy hasbeen expanded, and socialist consultative democracy is flourishing. The patriotic united front has been consolidated and developed, and new approaches have been adopted for work related to ethnic and religious affairs. Further progress has been made in ensuring our legislation is sound, law enforcementis strict, judicial justice is upheld, and the law is observed by everyone. Our efforts to build a country, government, and society based on the rule of law have been mutually reinforcing; the system of distinctively Chinese socialist rule of law has been steadily improved; and public awareness of the rule oflaw has risen markedly. Good progress has been made in piloting the reform of the national supervision system, and effective measures have been taken to reform the system of government administration and the judicial system, and develop systems to apply checks and oversight over the exercise of power. 
思想文化建设取得重大进展。 
We have made significant advances on the theoretical and cultural fronts. 
加强党对意识形态工作的领导，党的理论创新全面推进，马克思主义在意识形态领域的指导地位更加鲜明，中国特色社会主义和中国梦深入人心，社会主义核心价值观和中华优秀传统文化广泛弘扬，群众性精神文明创建活动扎实开展。公共文化服务水平不断提高，文艺创作持续繁荣，文化事业和文化产业蓬勃发展，互联网建设管理运用不断完善，全民健身和竞技体育全面发展。主旋律更加响亮，正能量更加强劲，文化自信得到彰显，国家文化软实力和中华文化影响力大幅提升，全党全社会思想上的团结统一更加巩固。 
We have strengthened Party leadership over ideological work and explored new ground in advancing Party related theories. The importance of Marxism as a guiding theory is even better appreciated. Socialism with Chinese characteristics and the Chinese Dream have been embraced by our people. Core socialist values and fine traditional Chinese culture are alive in the people’s hearts. Initiatives to improve public etiquette and ethical standards have proved successful. Public cultural services have been improved; art and literature are thriving, and cultural programs and industries are going strong. The development, administration, and functioning of internet services have been enhanced. Fitness-for-All programs and competitive sports have seen extensive development. Our country’s underlying values hold greater appeal than ever before, and the wave of positive energy felt throughout society is building. We, the Chinese people, have greater confidence in our own culture. China’s cultural soft power and the international influence of Chinese culture have increased significantly. There is greater unity in thinking both within the Party and throughout society. 
人民生活不断改善。 
We have steadily improved living standards. 
深入贯彻以人民为中心的发展思想，一大批惠民举措落地实施，人民获得感显著增强。脱贫攻坚战取得决定性进展，六千多万贫困人口稳定脱贫，贫困发生率从百分之十点二下降到百分之四以下。教育事业全面发展，中西部和农村教育明显加强。就业状况持续改善，城镇新增就业年均一千三百万人以上。城乡居民收入增速超过经济增速，中等收入群体持续扩大。覆盖城乡居民的社会保障体系基本建立，人民健康和医疗卫生水平大幅提高，保障性住房建设稳步推进。社会治理体系更加完善，社会大局保持稳定，国家安全全面加强。 
Our vision of making development people-centered has been actedon,a whole raft of initiatives to benefit the people has seen implementation, and the people’ssense offulfillment has grown stronger. Decisive progress has been made in the fight against poverty: more than 60 million people have been lifted out of poverty, and the poverty headcount ratio has dropped from 10.2 percent to less than 4 percent. All-round progress has been made in the development ofeducation, with remarkable advances made in the central and western regions and in rural areas.

Social governance systems have been improved; law and order has been maintained; and national security has been fully enhanced. 
生态文明建设成效显著。

We have devoted serious energy to ecological conservation. As a result, the entire Party and the whole country have becomemore purposeful and active in pursuing green development, and there has been a clear shift away fromthe tendency to neglect ecological and environmental protection. Efforts to develop a system for building an ecological civilization have been accelerated; the system of functional zoning has been steadily improved; and progress has been made in piloting the national park system. Across-the-board efforts to conserve resources have seen encouraging progress; the intensity of energy and resource consumption has been significantly reduced. Smooth progress has been made in major ecological conservation and restoration projects; and forest coverage has been increased. Ecological and environmental governance has been significantly strengthened, leading to marked improvements in the environment. Taking a driving seat in international cooperation to respond to climate change, China has become an important participant, contributor, and torchbearer in the global endeavor for ecological civilization.
强军兴军开创新局面。 
We have initiated a new stage in strengthening and revitalizing the armed forces. 
着眼于实现中国梦强军梦，制定新形势下军事战略方针，全力推进国防和军队现代化。召开古田全军政治工作会议，恢复和发扬我党我军光荣传统和优良作风，人民军队政治生态得到有效治理。国防和军队改革取得历史性突破，形成军委管总、战区主战、军种主建新格局，人民军队组织架构和力量体系实现革命性重塑。加强练兵备战，有效遂行海上维权、反恐维稳、抢险救灾、国际维和、亚丁湾护航、人道主义救援等重大任务，武器装备加快发展，军事斗争准备取得重大进展。人民军队在中国特色强军之路上迈出坚定步伐。 
With a view to realizing the Chinese Dream and the dream of building a powerful military, we have developed a strategy for the military under new circumstances, and have made every effort to modernize national defense and the armed forces. We convened the Gutian military political work meeting to revive and pass on the proud traditionsand fine conduct of our Party and our armed forces, and have seen a strong improvement in the political integrity of the people’s armed forces. Historic breakthroughs have been made in reforming national defense and the armed forces: a new military structure hasbeen established with the Central Military Commission exercising overall leadership, the theater commands responsible for military operations, and the services focusing on developing capabilities. This represents a revolutionary restructuring of the organization and the services of the people’sarmed forces. We have strengthenedmilitary training and war preparedness, and undertaken major missions related to the protection of maritimerights, countering terrorism, maintaining stability, disaster rescue and relief, international peacekeeping, escort services in the Gulf of Aden, and humanitarian assistance. We have stepped up weapons and equipment development and made major progress in enhancing military preparedness. The people’sarmedforces have taken solid strides onthe path of building a powerful military with Chinese characteristics.
港澳台工作取得新进展。 
We have made new progress in workrelated to Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. 
全面准确贯彻“一国两制”方针，牢牢掌握宪法和基本法赋予的中央对香港、澳门全面管治权，深化内地和港澳地区交流合作，保持香港、澳门繁荣稳定。坚持一个中国原则和“九二共识”，推动两岸关系和平发展，加强两岸经济文化交流合作，实现两岸领导人历史性会晤。妥善应对台湾局势变化，坚决反对和遏制“台独”分裂势力，有力维护台海和平稳定。 
We have fully and faithfully implemented the principle of “one country, two systems” and ensured that the central government exercises its overall jurisdiction over Hong Kong and Macao as mandated by China’s Constitution and the basic laws of the two special administrative regions. We have thus boosted exchanges and cooperation between the mainland and the two regions and maintained prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao. Wehave upheld the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus, promoted the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, strengthened cross-Straits economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation, and held a historic meeting between the leaders of the two sides. Wehave responded as appropriate to the political developments in Taiwan, resolutely opposed and deterred separatist elements advocating “Taiwan independence/7 and vigorously safeguarded peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits.
全方位外交布局深入展开。 
We have made further progress in China’s diplomacy on all fronts.
全面推进中国特色大国外交，形成全方位、多层次、立体化的外交布局，为我国发展营造了良好外部条件。实施共建“一带一路”倡议，发起创办亚洲基础设施投资银行，设立丝路基金，举办首届“一带一路”国际合作高峰论坛、亚太经合组织领导人非正式会议、二十国集团领导人杭州峰会、金砖国家领导人厦门会晤、亚信峰会。倡导构建人类命运共同体，促进全球治理体系变革。我国国际影响力、感召力、塑造力进一步提高，为世界和平与发展作出新的重大贡献。 
We have made all-round efforts in the pursuit of major country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, thus advancing China’s diplomatic agenda in a comprehensive, multilevel, multifaceted way and creating a favorable external environment for China’s development. We have jointly pursued the Belt and RoadInitiative, initiated the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, set up the Silk Road Fund, and hosted the First Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, the 22nd APEC Economic Leaders7 Meeting, the G20 2016 Summit in Hangzhou, the BRICS Summit in Xiamen, and the Fourth Summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia. China champions the development of a community with a shared future for mankind, and has encouraged the evolution of the global governance system. With this we have seen a further rise in China’s international influence, ability to inspire, and power to shape; and China has made great new contributions to global peace and development. 
全面从严治党成效卓著。 
We have achieved remarkable outcomes in ensuring full and strict governance over the Party. 
全面加强党的领导和党的建设，坚决改变管党治党宽松软状况。推动全党尊崇党章，增强政治意识、大局意识、核心意识、看齐意识，坚决维护党中央权威和集中统一领导，严明党的政治纪律和政治规矩，层层落实管党治党政治责任。 
We have made sweeping efforts to strengthen Party leadership and Party building, and taken strong action to transform lax and weak governance over the Party. We encourage all Party members to hold the Party Constitution in great esteem. We urge them to strengthen their consciousness of the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, followthe leadership core, and keep in alignment, and to uphold the authority of the Central Committeeand its centralized, unified leadership. We have tightened political discipline and rules to ensure that political responsibility for governance over the Party is fulfilled at each level of the Party organization. 
坚持照镜子、正衣冠、洗洗澡、治治病的要求，开展党的群众路线教育实践活动和“三严三实”专题教育，推进 “两学一做”学习教育常态化制度化，全党理想信念更加坚定、党性更加坚强。贯彻新时期好干部标准，选人用人状况和风气明显好转。党的建设制度改革深入推进，党内法规制度体系不断完善。 
We have committed to “examining ourselves in the mirror, tidying our attire, taking a bath, and treatingour ailments,” launched activities to see members command and act on the Party’s mass line, and initiated a campaign for the observance of the Three Stricts and Three Earnests. We have regularized and institutionalized the requirement for all Party members to have a solid understanding of the Party Constitution, Party regulations, and related major policy addresses and to meet Party standards. As a result, the ideals and convictions of all Party members have been strengthened and their sense of Party consciousness has deepened. We have adopted standards fitting for a new era to assess the caliber of officials’ and achieved a notable improvement in the way officials are selected and appointed. Further advances have been made in the reformofthe institutional framework for Party building, and continuous improvements have been made to the system of Party regulations. 
把纪律挺在前面，着力解决人民群众反映最强烈、对党的执政基础威胁最大的突出问题。出台中央八项规定，严厉整治形式主义、官僚主义、享乐主义和奢靡之风，坚决反对特权。巡视利剑作用彰显，实现中央和省级党委巡视全覆盖。坚持反腐败无禁区、全覆盖、零容忍，坚定不移“打虎”、“拍蝇”、“猎狐”，不敢腐的目标初步实现，不能腐的笼子越扎越牢，不想腐的堤坝正在构筑，反腐败斗争压倒性态势已经形成并巩固发展。 
We have given top priority to ensuring compliance with Party discipline, and tackled the prominent problems that prompt the strongest public reaction and that threaten to erode the very foundation of the Party’s governance. We adopted the eight-point decision on improving Party and government conduct, have taken tough action against the practice of formalities for formalities’ sake, bureaucratism, hedonism, and extravagance, and have staunchly opposed privilege seeking. Disciplinary inspections have cut like a blade through corruption and misconduct; they have covered every Party committee in all departments at the central and provincial levels. No place has been out of bounds, no ground left unturned, and no tolerance shown in the fight against corruption. We have taken firm action to “take out tigers,” ’’swat flies,” and “hunt down foxes.” The goal of creating a deterrent against corruption has been initially attained; the cage of institutionsthat preventscorruptionhasbeen strengthened; and moral defensesagainst corruption are in the making. The anti-corruption campaign has built into a crushing tide, is being consolidated, and continues to develop. 
五年来的成就是全方位的、开创性的，五年来的变革是深层次的、根本性的。五年来，我们党以巨大的政治勇气和强烈的责任担当，提出一系列新理念新思想新战略，出台一系列重大方针政策，推出一系列重大举措，推进一系列重大工作，解决了许多长期想解决而没有解决的难题，办成了许多过去想办而没有办成的大事，推动党和国家事业发生历史性变革。这些历史性变革，对党和国家事业发展具有重大而深远的影响。
The achievements of the past five years have touched every area and broken new ground; the changes in China over the past five years have been profound and fundamental. For five years, our Party has demonstrated tremendous political courage and a powerful sense of mission as it has developed new ideas, new thinking, and new strategies, adopted a raft of major principles and policies, launched a host of major initiatives, and pushed ahead with many major tasks. We have solved many tough problems that were long on the agenda but never resolved, and accomplished many things that were wanted but never got done. With this, we have prompted historic shifts in the cause ofthe Party and the country. These historic changes will have a powerful and far-reaching effect on the development of this cause. 
五年来，我们勇于面对党面临的重大风险考验和党内存在的突出问题，以顽强意志品质正风肃纪、反腐惩恶，消除了党和国家内部存在的严重隐患，党内政治生活气象更新，党内政治生态明显好转，党的创造力、凝聚力、战斗力显著增强，党的团结统一更加巩固，党群关系明显改善，党在革命性锻造中更加坚强，焕发出新的强大生机活力，为党和国家事业发展提供了坚强政治保证。 
Over the past five years, we have acted with courage to confront major risks and tests facing the Party and to address prominent problems within the Party itself. With firm resolve, we have tightened discipline and improved Party conduct, fought corruption and punished wrongdoing, and removed serious potential dangers in the Party and the country. As a result, both the intraparty political atmosphere and the political ecosystem of the Party have improved markedly. The Party’s ability to innovate, power to unite, and energy to fight have all been significantly strengthened; Party solidarity and unity have been reinforced, and our engagement with the people has been greatly improved. Revolutionary tempering has made our Party stronger and it now radiates with great vitality. With this, efforts to develop the cause of the Party and the country have gained a strong political underpinning. 
同时，必须清醒看到，我们的工作还存在许多不足，也面临不少困难和挑战。主要是： 
But we must be very clear: There are still many inadequacies in our work and many difficulties and challenges to face. The main ones are as follows. 
发展不平衡不充分的一些突出问题尚未解决，发展质量和效益还不高，创新能力不够强，实体经济水平有待提高，生态环境保护任重道远；民生领域还有不少短板，脱贫攻坚任务艰巨，城乡区域发展和收入分配差距依然较大，群众在就业、教育、医疗、居住、养老等方面面临不少难题；社会文明水平尚需提高；社会矛盾和问题交织叠加，全面依法治国任务依然繁重，国家治理体系和治理能力有待加强；意识形态领域斗争依然复杂，国家安全面临新情况；一些改革部署和重大政策措施需要进一步落实；党的建设方面还存在不少薄弱环节。这些问题，必须着力加以解决。 
Some acute problems caused by unbalanced and inadequate development await solutions; and the quality and effect of development are not what they should be. China’s ability to innovate needs to be stronger, the real economy awaits improvement, and we have a long way to go in protecting the environment. In work on public wellbeing there are still many areas where we fall short; and poverty alleviation remains a formidable task. There are still large disparities in development between rural and urban areas, between regions, and in income distribution; and our people face many difficulties in employment, education, healthcare, housing, and elderly care. The level of civic-mindedness needs further improvement. Social tensions and problems are intertwined, much remains to be done in seeing the country’s governance is based in law, and China’s system and capacity for governance need to be further strengthened. Ideological struggle is still complicated, and in national security we face new developments. Some reform plans and major policies and measures need to be better implemented. Many dimensions of Party building remain weak. These are all problems that demand our full attention to resolve. 
五年来的成就，是党中央坚强领导的结果，更是全党全国各族人民共同奋斗的结果。我代表中共中央，向全国各族人民，向各民主党派、各人民团体和各界爱国人士，向香港特别行政区同胞、澳门特别行政区同胞和台湾同胞以及广大侨胞，向关心和支持中国现代化建设的各国朋友，表示衷心的感谢！ 
The achievements of the past five years are the result of the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee, and, more importantly, the result of all Party members and all the Chinese people pulling together in their pursuit. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, I express our heartfelt thanks to the people of all ethnic groups, to all other political parties, to people’s organizations, and patriotic figures from all sectors of society, to our fellow countrymen and women in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions and in Taiwan, to overseas Chinese, and to all our friends from around the world who have shown understanding and support for China’s modernization. 
同志们！ 
Comrades, 
改革开放之初，我们党发出了走自己的路、建设中国特色社会主义的伟大号召。从那时以来，我们党团结带领全国各族人民不懈奋斗，推动我国经济实力、科技实力、国防实力、综合国力进入世界前列，推动我国国际地位实现前所未有的提升，党的面貌、国家的面貌、人民的面貌、军队的面貌、中华民族的面貌发生了前所未有的变化，中华民族正以崭新姿态屹立于世界的东方。 
In the early days of reform and opening up, the Party made a clarion call for us to take a path of our own and build socialismwith Chinese characteristics. Sincethat time, the Party has united and led all the Chinese people in a tireless struggle, propelling China into a leading position in terms of economic and technological strength, defense capabilities, and composite national strength. China’s international standing has risen as never before. Our Party, our country, our people, our forces, and our nation have changed in ways without precedent. The Chinese nation, with an entirely new posture, now stands tall and firmin the East. 
经过长期努力，中国特色社会主义进入了新时代，这是我国发展新的历史方位。 
With decades of hard work, socialism with Chinese characteristics has crossed the threshold into a new era. This is a new historic juncture in China’s development. 
中国特色社会主义进入新时代，意味着近代以来久经磨难的中华民族迎来了从站起来、富起来到强起来的伟大飞跃，迎来了实现中华民族伟大复兴的光明前景；意味着科学社会主义在二十一世纪的中国焕发出强大生机活力，在世界上高高举起了中国特色社会主义伟大旗帜；意味着中国特色社会主义道路、理论、制度、文化不断发展，拓展了发展中国家走向现代化的途径，给世界上那些既希望加快发展又希望保持自身独立性的国家和民族提供了全新选择，为解决人类问题贡献了中国智慧和中国方案。 
This iswhat socialismwith Chinesecharacteristics entering a new era means: The Chinese nation, which since modern times began had endured so much for so long, has achieved a tremendous transformation—it has stood up, grown rich, and become strong; and it now embraces the brilliant prospects of rejuvenation.It means that scientific socialismis full of vitality in 21st century China, and that the bannerof socialism with Chinese characteristics is now flying high and proud for all to see. It means that the path, the theory, the system, and the culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics have kept developing, blazing a new trail for other developing countries to achieve modernization. It offers a new option for other countries and nations who want to speed up their development while preserving their independence; and it offers Chinese wisdom and a Chinese approach to solving the problems facing mankind. 
这个新时代，是承前启后、继往开来、在新的历史条件下继续夺取中国特色社会主义伟大胜利的时代，是决胜全面建成小康社会、进而全面建设社会主义现代化强国的时代，是全国各族人民团结奋斗、不断创造美好生活、逐步实现全体人民共同富裕的时代，是全体中华儿女勠力同心、奋力实现中华民族伟大复兴中国梦的时代，是我国日益走近世界舞台中央、不断为人类作出更大贡献的时代。 
This new era will be an era of building on past successes to further advance our cause, and of continuing in anew historical context to strive for the success of socialismwith Chinese characteristics. It will be an era of securing a decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and of moving on to all-out effortsto build a greatmodern socialist country. It will be an era for the Chinese people of all ethnic groups to work together and work hard to create a better life for themselves and ultimately achieve common prosperity for everyone. It will be an era for all of us, the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, to strive with one heart to realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation. It will be an era that sees China movingcloser to center stage and making greater contributions to mankind. 
中国特色社会主义进入新时代，我国社会主要矛盾已经转化为人民日益增长的美好生活需要和不平衡不充分的发展之间的矛盾。我国稳定解决了十几亿人的温饱问题，总体上实现小康，不久将全面建成小康社会，人民美好生活需要日益广泛，不仅对物质文化生活提出了更高要求，而且在民主、法治、公平、正义、安全、环境等方面的要求日益增长。同时，我国社会生产力水平总体上显著提高，社会生产能力在很多方面进入世界前列，更加突出的问题是发展不平衡不充分，这已经成为满足人民日益增长的美好生活需要的主要制约因素。 
As socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, the principal contradiction facing Chinese society has evolved. What we now face is the contradiction between unbalanced and inadequate development and the people’s ever-growing needs for a better life. China has seen the basic needs of over a billion people met, has basically made it possible for people to live decent lives, and will soon bring the building of amoderately prosperous societyto a successful completion. The needs to be met for the people to live a better life are increasingly broad. Not only have their material and cultural needs grown; their demands for democracy, rule of law, fairness and justice, security, and a better environment are increasing. While China’s overall productive forces have significantly improved and in many areas our production capacity leads the world, our problem is that our development is unbalanced and inadequate. This has become the main constraining factor in meeting the people’s increasing needs for a better life. 
必须认识到，我国社会主要矛盾的变化是关系全局的历史性变化，对党和国家工作提出了许多新要求。我们要在继续推动发展的基础上，着力解决好发展不平衡不充分问题，大力提升发展质量和效益，更好满足人民在经济、政治、文化、社会、生态等方面日益增长的需要，更好推动人的全面发展、社会全面进步。 
We must recognize that the evolution of the principal contradiction facing Chinese society represents a historic shift that affects the whole landscape and that creates many new demands for the work of the Party and the country. Building on continued efforts to sustain development, we must devote great energy to addressing development’s imbalances and inadequacies, and push hard to improve the quality and effect of development. With this, we will be better placed to meet the ever-growing economic, political, cultural,social, and ecological needs of our people, and to promote well-rounded human development and all-round social progress. 
我们必须认识到，我国社会主要矛盾的变化，没有改变我们对我国社会主义所处历史阶段的判断，我国仍处于并将长期处于社会主义初级阶段的基本国情没有变，我国是世界最大发展中国家的国际地位没有变。全党要牢牢把握社会主义初级阶段这个基本国情，牢牢立足社会主义初级阶段这个最大时机，牢牢坚持党的基本路线这个党和国家的生命线、人民的幸福线。领导和团结全国各族人民以经济建设为中心,坚持四项基本原则,坚持改革开放,自力更生,艰苦创业,为把我国建设成为富强、民主、文明，和谐，美丽的社会主义现代化国家而奋斗。 
We must recognize that the evolution of the principal contradiction facing Chinese society does not change our assessment of the present stage of socialism in China. The basic dimension of the Chinese context—that our country is still and will long remain in the primary stage of socialism—has not changed. China’s international status as the world’s largest developing country has not changed. The whole Party must be completely clear about this fundamental dimension of our national context, and must base our work on this most important reality —the primary stage of socialism. We must remain fully committed to the Party’s basic line as the source that keeps the Party and the country going and that brings happiness to the people. We must lead andunite the Chinese people of all ethnic groups in fulfilling the central task of economic development. We must uphold the Four Cardinal Principles, continue to reform and open up, be self-reliant, hardworking, and enterprising, and strive to build China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious, and beautiful. 
同志们！ 
Comrades, 
中国特色社会主义进入新时代，在中华人民共和国发展史上、中华民族发展史上具有重大意义，在世界社会主义发展史上、人类社会发展史上也具有重大意义。全党要坚定信心、奋发有为，让中国特色社会主义展现出更加强大的生命力！ 
Chinese socialism’s entrance into a new era is, in the historyof the development of the People’s Republic of China and the history of the development of the Chinese nation, of tremendous importance. In the history of the development of international socialism and the history of the development of human society it is of tremendousimportance. Our entire Party should develop unshakeable confidence, work hard and work well to see socialism with Chinese characteristics display even stronger vitality. 
二、新时代中国共产党的历史使命 
The New Era: The Historic Mission of the Communist Party of China 
一百年前，十月革命一声炮响，给中国送来了马克思列宁主义。中国先进分子从马克思列宁主义的科学真理中看到了解决中国问题的出路。在近代以后中国社会的剧烈运动中，在中国人民反抗封建统治和外来侵略的激烈斗争中，在马克思列宁主义同中国工人运动的结合过程中，一九二一年中国共产党应运而生。从此，中国人民谋求民族独立、人民解放和国家富强、人民幸福的斗争就有了主心骨，中国人民就从精神上由被动转为主动。 
A hundred years ago, the salvoes of the October Revolution brought Marxism-Leninism to China. In the scientific truth of Marxism-Leninism, Chinese progressives saw a solution to China’s problems. With the advent of modern times, Chinese society became embroiled in intense upheavals; this was a time of fierce struggle as the Chinese people resisted feudal rule and foreign aggression. It was in the midst of this, in 1921, as Marxism-Leninismwas integrated withthe Chinese workers’ movement, that the Communist Party of China was born. From that moment on, the Chinese people have had in the Party a backbone for their pursuit of national independence and liberation, of a stronger and more prosperous country, and of their own happiness; and the mindset of the Chinese people has changed, from passivity to taking the initiative. 
中华民族有五千多年的文明历史，创造了灿烂的中华文明，为人类作出了卓越贡献，成为世界上伟大的民族。鸦片战争后，中国陷入内忧外患的黑暗境地，中国人民经历了战乱频仍、山河破碎、民不聊生的深重苦难。为了民族复兴，无数仁人志士不屈不挠、前仆后继，进行了可歌可泣的斗争，进行了各式各样的尝试，但终究未能改变旧中国的社会性质和中国人民的悲惨命运。 
With a history of more than 5,000 years, our nation created a splendid civilization, made remarkable contributions to mankind, and became one of the world’s great nations. But with the Opium War of 1840, China was plunged into the darkness of domestic turmoil and foreign aggression; its people were ravaged by wars, saw their homeland torn, and livedin poverty and despair. With tenacity and heroism, countless dedicated patriots fought, pressed ahead against the odds, and tried every possible means to seek the nation’s salvation. But despite their efforts, they were powerless to change the nature of society in old China and the plight of the Chinese people. 
实现中华民族伟大复兴是近代以来中华民族最伟大的梦想。中国共产党一经成立，就把实现共产主义作为党的最高理想和最终目标，义无反顾肩负起实现中华民族伟大复兴的历史使命，团结带领人民进行了艰苦卓绝的斗争，谱写了气吞山河的壮丽史诗。 
National rejuvenation has been the greatest dream of the Chinese people since modern times began. At its founding, the Communist Party of China made realizing Communism its highest ideal and its ultimate goal, and shouldered the historic mission of national rejuvenation. In pursuing this goal, the Party has united the Chinese people and led them through arduous struggles to epic accomplishments. 
我们党深刻认识到，实现中华民族伟大复兴，必须推翻压在中国人民头上的帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座大山，实现民族独立、人民解放、国家统一、社会稳定。我们党团结带领人民找到了一条以农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的正确革命道路，进行了二十八年浴血奋战，完成了新民主主义革命，一九四九年建立了中华人民共和国，实现了中国从几千年封建专制政治向人民民主的伟大飞跃。 
Our Party was deeply aware that, to achieve national rejuvenation, it was critical to topple the three mountains of imperialism,feudalism,and bureaucrat-capitalismthat were oppressing the Chinese people, and realize China’s independence, the people’s liberation, national reunification, and social stability. Our Party united the people and led themin embarking on the right revolutionary path, using rural areas to encircle the cities and seizing state power with military force. We completed the New Democratic Revolution through 28 years of painful struggle, and founded the People’s Republic of China in 1949, thus marking China’s great transition from a millennia-old feudal autocracy to a people’s democracy.
我们党深刻认识到，实现中华民族伟大复兴，必须建立符合我国实际的先进社会制度。我们党团结带领人民完成社会主义革命，确立社会主义基本制度，推进社会主义建设，完成了中华民族有史以来最为广泛而深刻的社会变革，为当代中国一切发展进步奠定了根本政治前提和制度基础，实现了中华民族由近代不断衰落到根本扭转命运、持续走向繁荣富强的伟大飞跃。
Our Party was deeply aware that, to achieve national rejuvenation, it was essential to establish an advanced social system that fits China’s reality. It united the people and led them in completing socialist revolution, establishing socialism as China’s basic system, and advancing socialist construction. This completed the broadest and most profound social transformation in the history of the Chinese nation. It created the fundamental political conditions and the institutional foundation for achieving all development and progress in China today. Thus wasmade a great transition: The Chinese nation reversed its fate from the continuous decline of modem times to steady progress toward prosperity and strength. 
我们党深刻认识到，实现中华民族伟大复兴，必须合乎时代潮流、顺应人民意愿，勇于改革开放，让党和人民事业始终充满奋勇前进的强大动力。我们党团结带领人民进行改革开放新的伟大革命，破除阻碍国家和民族发展的一切思想和体制障碍，开辟了中国特色社会主义道路，使中国大踏步赶上时代。 
Our Party was deeply aware that,to achieve national rejuvenation, it was imperative to follow the tide of the times, respond to the wishes of the people, and have the courage to reform and open; and thisawareness created apowerful force for advancing the causeof the Party and the people. Our Party united the people and led them in launching the great new revolution of reform and opening up, in removing all ideological and institutional barriers to our country and nation’s development, and in embarking on the path of socialismwith Chinese characteristics. Thus was China able to stride ahead to catch up with the times. 
九十六年来，为了实现中华民族伟大复兴的历史使命，无论是弱小还是强大，无论是顺境还是逆境，我们党都初心不改、矢志不渝，团结带领人民历经千难万险，付出巨大牺牲，敢于面对曲折，勇于修正错误，攻克了一个又一个看似不可攻克的难关，创造了一个又一个彪炳史册的人间奇迹。 
Over the past 96 years, to accomplish the historic mission of national rejuvenation, whether in times of weakness or strength, whether in times of adversity or smooth sailing, our Party has never forgotten its founding mission, nor wavered in its pursuit. It has united the people and led them in conquering countless challenges, making enormous sacrifices, meeting setbacks squarely, and courageously righting wrongs. Thus we have, time and again, overcome the seemingly insurmountable and created miracle upon miracle. 
同志们！ 
Comrades, 
今天，我们比历史上任何时期都更接近、更有信心和能力实现中华民族伟大复兴的目标。 
Today, we are closer, more confident, and more capable than ever before of making the goal of national rejuvenation a reality. 
行百里者半九十。中华民族伟大复兴，绝不是轻轻松松、敲锣打鼓就能实现的。全党必须准备付出更为艰巨、更为艰苦的努力。 
As the Chinese saying goes, the last leg of a journey just marks the halfway point. Achieving national rejuvenation will be no walk in the park; it will takemore than drum beating and gong clanging to get there. Every one of us in the Party must be prepared to work even harder toward this goal. 
实现伟大梦想，必须进行伟大斗争。社会是在矛盾运动中前进的，有矛盾就会有斗争。我们党要团结带领人民有效应对重大挑战、抵御重大风险、克服重大阻力、解决重大矛盾，必须进行具有许多新的历史特点的伟大斗争，任何贪图享受、消极懈怠、回避矛盾的思想和行为都是错误的。全党要更加自觉地坚持党的领导和我国社会主义制度，坚决反对一切削弱、歪曲、否定党的领导和我国社会主义制度的言行；更加自觉地维护人民利益，坚决反对一切损害人民利益、脱离群众的行为；更加自觉地投身改革创新时代潮流，坚决破除一切顽瘴痼疾；更加自觉地维护我国主权、安全、发展利益，坚决反对一切分裂祖国、破坏民族团结和社会和谐稳定的行为；更加自觉地防范各种风险，坚决战胜一切在政治、经济、文化、社会等领域和自然界出现的困难和挑战。全党要充分认识这场伟大斗争的长期性、复杂性、艰巨性，发扬斗争精神，提高斗争本领，不断夺取伟大斗争新胜利。 
Realizing our great dream demands a great struggle. It is in the movement of contradictions that a society advances; where there is contradiction there is struggle. If our Party is to unite and lead the people to effectively respond to major challenges, withstand major risks, overcome major obstacles, and address major conflicts, it must undertake a great struggle with many new contemporary features. All thinking and behavior in the vein of pleasure seeking, inaction and sloth, and problem avoidance are unacceptable. Every one of us in the Party must do more to uphold Party leadership and the Chinese socialist system, and resolutely oppose all statements and actions that undermine, distort, or negate them. We must do more to protect our people’s interests, and firmly oppose all moves that damage their interests or put distance between the Party and the people. We must do more to devote our energies to the contemporary current of reform and innovation, and resolvedly address deep-rooted problems. We must do more to safeguard China’s sovereignty, security, and development interests, and staunchly oppose all attempts to split China or undermine its ethnic unity, social harmony and stability. We must do more to guard against all kinds of risks, and work determinedly to prevail over every political, economic, cultural, social, and natural difficulty and challenge. Every Party member must fully appreciate the long-term, complex, and onerous nature of this great struggle; we must be ready to fight, build our ability, and keep striving to secure new victories in this great struggle. Realizing our great dream demands a great project. This project is the great new project of Party building that is just getting into full swing. As history has shown and will continue to bear witnessto, without the leadership of the Communist Party of China, national rejuvenation would be just wishful thinking. To remain the vanguard of the times, the backbone of the nation, and a Marxist governing party, our Party must always hold itself to the highest standards. Every Party member must be more actively involved in enhancing Party consciousness, and demonstrate commitment to Party principles. We must have the courage to face problems squarely, be braced for the pain, act to remove whatever undermines the Party’s purity and advanced nature, and rid ourselves of any virus that erodes the Party’s health. We must keep on strengthening the Party’s ability to lead politically, to guide through theory, to organize the people, and to inspire society, thus ensuring that the Party’s great vitality and strong ability are forever maintained. 
实现伟大梦想，必须建设伟大工程。这个伟大工程就是我们党正在深入推进的党的建设新的伟大工程。历史已经并将继续证明，没有中国共产党的领导，民族复兴必然是空想。我们党要始终成为时代先锋、民族脊梁，始终成为马克思主义执政党，自身必须始终过硬。全党要更加自觉地坚定党性原则，勇于直面问题，敢于刮骨疗毒，消除一切损害党的先进性和纯洁性的因素，清除一切侵蚀党的健康肌体的病毒，不断增强党的政治领导力、思想引领力、群众组织力、社会号召力，确保我们党永葆旺盛生命力和强大战斗力。实现伟大梦想，必须推进伟大事业。中国特色社会主义是改革开放以来党的全部理论和实践的主题，是党和人民历尽千辛万苦、付出巨大代价取得的根本成就。中国特色社会主义道路是实现社会主义现代化、创造人民美好生活的必由之路，中国特色社会主义理论体系是指导党和人民实现中华民族伟大复兴的正确理论，中国特色社会主义制度是当代中国发展进步的根本制度保障，中国特色社会主义文化是激励全党全国各族人民奋勇前进的强大精神力量。全党要更加自觉地增强道路自信、理论自信、制度自信、文化自信，既不走封闭僵化的老路，也不走改旗易帜的邪路，保持政治定力，坚持实干兴邦，始终坚持和发展中国特色社会主义。 
Realizing our great dream demands a great cause. SocialismwithChinese characteristics has been the focus of all of the Party’s theories and practice since reform and opening up began. It is the fundamental achievement of our Party and our people made through countless hardships at enormous cost. The path of socialismwith Chinese characteristicsis theonly pathto socialist modernizationand a better life for the people. The theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the right theory to guide the Party and people to realize national rejuvenation. The system of socialism with Chinese characteristics provides the fundamental institutional guarantee for progress and development in contemporary China. The culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics is a powerful source of strength that inspires all members of the Party and the people of all ethnic groups in China. Our whole Party must strengthen our confidence in the path, theory, system, and culture of socialismwith Chinese characteristics. We must neither retrace our steps to the rigidity and isolation of the past, nor take the wrong turn by changing our nature and abandoning our system. We must maintain our political orientation, do the good solid work that sees our country thrive, and continue to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
伟大斗争，伟大工程，伟大事业，伟大梦想，紧密联系、相互贯通、相互作用，其中起决定性作用的是党的建设新的伟大工程。推进伟大工程，要结合伟大斗争、伟大事业、伟大梦想的实践来进行，确保党在世界形势深刻变化的历史进程中始终走在时代前列，在应对国内外各种风险和考验的历史进程中始终成为全国人民的主心骨，在坚持和发展中国特色社会主义的历史进程中始终成为坚强领导核心。 
This great struggle, great project, great cause, and great dream are closely connected, flow seamlessly into each other, and are mutually reinforcing. Among them, the great new project ofParty building plays the decisive role. All work to advance this project must go hand in hand with that geared toward the struggle, the cause, and the dream. We must see that as history progresses and the world undergoes profound changes, the Party remains always ahead of the times; that as history progresses and we respond to risks and tests at home and abroad, the Party remains always the backbone of the nation; and that as history progresses and we continue to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, the Party remains always a powerful leadership core. 
同志们！ 
Comrades, 
使命呼唤担当，使命引领未来。我们要不负人民重托、无愧历史选择，在新时代中国特色社会主义的伟大实践中，以党的坚强领导和顽强奋斗，激励全体中华儿女不断奋进，凝聚起同心共筑中国梦的磅礴力量！ 
Ourmission is a call to action; our mission steers the course to the future. We must liveup to the trust the people have placed in us and prove ourselves worthy of history’s choice. In the great endeavors of building socialismwith Chinese characteristics inthe new era, let us get behind the strong leadership of the Party and engage in a tenacious struggle. Let all of us, the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, come together, keep going, and create a mighty force that enables us to realize the Chinese Dream.
三、新时代中国特色社会主义思想和基本方略 
The Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and the Basic Policy 
十八大以来，国内外形势变化和我国各项事业发展都给我们提出了一个重大时代课题，这就是必须从理论和实践结合上系统回答新时代坚持和发展什么样的中国特色社会主义、怎样坚持和发展中国特色社会主义，包括新时代坚持和发展中国特色社会主义的总目标、总任务、总体布局、战略布局和发展方向、发展方式、发展动力、战略步骤、外部条件、政治保证等基本问题，并且要根据新的实践对经济、政治、法治、科技、文化、教育、民生、民族、宗教、社会、生态文明、国家安全、国防和军队、 “一国两制”和祖国统一、统一战线、外交、党的建设等各方面作出理论分析和政策指导，以利于更好坚持和发展中国特色社会主义。 
Since our 18th National Congress, changes both in and outside China, and the progress made in all areas of China’s endeavors, have presented us with a profound question—the question of an era. Our answer must be a systematic combination of theory and practice and must address what kind of socialism with Chinese characteristics the new era requires us to uphold and develop, and how we should go about doing it. This involves fundamental issues likethe overarching objectives, tasks, plan, and strategy for upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era; like the direction, model, and driving force of development, and the strategic steps, external conditions, and political guarantees. As well as this, to uphold and developsocialismwith Chinese characteristics, we should, based on new practice, undertake theoretical analysis and produce policy guidance on the economy, political affairs, rule oflaw, science and technology, culture, education, the wellbeing of our people, ethnic and religious affairs, social development, ecological conservation, national security, defense and the armed forces, the principle of “one country, two systems” and national reunification, the united front, foreign affairs, and Party building. 
围绕这个重大时代课题，我们党坚持以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想、邓小平理论、“三个代表”重要思想、科学发展观为指导，坚持解放思想、实事求是、与时俱进、求真务实，坚持辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义，紧密结合新的时代条件和实践要求，以全新的视野深化对共产党执政规律、社会主义建设规律、人类社会发展规律的认识，进行艰辛理论探索，取得重大理论创新成果，形成了新时代中国特色社会主义思想。
In answering this question, our Party has been guided by Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development. It has continued to free our minds, seek truth fromfacts, move withthe times, and apply a realistic and pragmatic approach. In answering this question, our Party has continued to uphold dialectical and historical materialism; has considered carefully the new conditions of the era and the new requirements of practice; and has adopted an entirely new perspective to deepen its understanding of the laws that underlie governance by the Communist Party, the development of socialism, and the evolution of human society. It has worked hard to undertake theoretical explorations, and has achieved major theoretical innovations, ultimately giving shape to the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. 
新时代中国特色社会主义思想，明确坚持和发展中国特色社会主义，总任务是实现社会主义现代化和中华民族伟大复兴，在全面建成小康社会的基础上，分两步走在本世纪中叶建成富强民主文明和谐美丽的社会主义现代化强国；明确新时代我国社会主要矛盾是人民日益增长的美好生活需要和不平衡不充分的发展之间的矛盾，必须坚持以人民为中心的发展思想，不断促进人的全面发展、全体人民共同富裕；明确中国特色社会主义事业总体布局是 “五位一体”、战略布局是“四个全面”，强调坚定道路自信、理论自信、制度自信、文化自信；明确全面深化改革总目标是完善和发展中国特色社会主义制度、推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化；明确全面推进依法治国总目标是建设中国特色社会主义法治体系、建设社会主义法治国家；明确党在新时代的强军目标是建设一支听党指挥、能打胜仗、作风优良的人民军队，把人民军队建设成为世界一流军队；明确中国特色大国外交要推动构建新型国际关系，推动构建人类命运共同体；明确中国特色社会主义最本质的特征是中国共产党领导，中国特色社会主义制度的最大优势是中国共产党领导，党是最高政治领导力量，提出新时代党的建设总要求，突出政治建设在党的建设中的重要地位。 
The Thought on Socialismwith Chinese Characteristics for aNew Era makes certain things clear: It makes clear that the overarching goal of upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics is to realize socialist modernization and national rejuvenation, and, that on the basis of finishing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, a two-step approach should be taken to build China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious, and beautiful by the middle ofthe century. It makes clear that the principal contradiction facing Chinese society in the new era is that between unbalanced and inadequate development and the people’s ever-growing needs for a better life. We must therefore continue commitment to our people-centered philosophy of development, and work to promote well-rounded human development and common prosperity for everyone. It makes clear thattheoverall plan for building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the five-sphere integrated plan, and the overall strategy is the four-pronged comprehensive strategy. It highlights the importance of fostering stronger confidence in the path, theory, system, and culture of socialismwith Chinese characteristics. It makes clear that the overall goal of deepening reformin every fieldis to improve and develop the systemof socialism with Chinese characteristics and modernize China’s systemand capacity for governance. It makes clear that the overall goal of comprehensively advancing law-based governance is to establish a system of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics and build a country of socialist rule of law. It makes clear that the Party’s goal of building a strong military in the new era is to build the people’s forces into world-class forces that obey the Party’s command, can fight and win, and maintain excellent conduct. It makes clear that major country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics aims to foster a new type ofinternational relations and build a community with a shared future for mankind. It makes clear that the defining feature of socialismwith Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Communist Party of China; thegreatest strength of the systemofsocialismwith Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Communist Party of China; the Party isthe highest force for political leadership. The Thought sets forth the general requirements for Party building in the new era and underlines the importance of political work in Party building.
新时代中国特色社会主义思想，是对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想、邓小平理论、“三个代表”重要思想、科学发展观的继承和发展，是马克思主义中国化最新成果，是党和人民实践经验和集体智慧的结晶，是中国特色社会主义理论体系的重要组成部分，是全党全国人民为实现中华民族伟大复兴而奋斗的行动指南，必须长期坚持并不断发展。 
The Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era builds on and further enriches Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development. It represents the latest achievement in adapting Marxism to the Chinese context and encapsulates the practical experience and collective wisdom of our Party and the people. It is an important component of the systemof theories of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and a guide to action for all our members and all the Chinese people as we strive to achieve national rejuvenation. This Thought must be adhered to and steadily developed on a long-term basis. 
全党要深刻领会新时代中国特色社会主义思想的精神实质和丰富内涵，在各项工作中全面准确贯彻落实。 
Everyone in the Party should develop a good grasp of the essence and rich implications of the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and fully and faithfully apply it in all our work. 
（一）坚持党对一切工作的领导。 
Ensuring Party leadership over all work 
党政军民学，东西南北中，党是领导一切的。必须增强政治意识、大局意识、核心意识、看齐意识，自觉维护党中央权威和集中统一领导，自觉在思想上政治上行动上同党中央保持高度一致，完善坚持党的领导的体制机制，坚持稳中求进工作总基调，统筹推进 “五位一体”总体布局，协调推进 “四个全面”战略布局，提高党把方向、谋大局、定政策、促改革的能力和定力，确保党始终总揽全局、协调各方。 
The Party exercises overall leadership over all areas of endeavor in every part of the country. We must strengthen our consciousnessofthe need to maintain political integrity, thinkinbig-pictureterms, follow the leadership core, and keep in alignment. We must work harder to uphold the authority and centralized, unified leadershipof the Central Committee, and closely follow theCentral Committee in terms of our thinking, political orientation, and actions. We must improve the institutions and mechanismsfor upholding Party leadership, remain committed to the underlying principle of pursuing progresswhile ensuringstability,andensure coordinatedimplementation of the five-sphere integrated plan and the four-pronged comprehensive strategy. Wemust strengthen the Party’s ability and resolve to chart our course, craft overall plans, design policy, and promote reform; and we must ensure the Party always provides overall leadership and coordinates the efforts of all involved. 
（二）坚持以人民为中心。 
Committing to a people-centered approach
人民是历史的创造者，是决定党和国家前途命运的根本力量。必须坚持人民主体地位，坚持立党为公、执政为民，践行全心全意为人民服务的根本宗旨，把党的群众路线贯彻到治国理政全部活动之中，把人民对美好生活的向往作为奋斗目标，依靠人民创造历史伟业。 
The people are the creators of history; they are the fundamental force that determines our Party and country’s future. We must ensure the principal status of the people, and adhere to the Party’s commitment to serving the public good and exercising power in the interests of the people. We must observe the Party’s fundamental purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people, and put into practice the Party’s mass line in all aspects of governance. We must regard as our goal the people’s aspirations to live a better life, and rely on the people to move history forward. 
（三）坚持全面深化改革。 
Continuing to comprehensively deepen reform 
只有社会主义才能救中国，只有改革开放才能发展中国、发展社会主义、发展马克思主义。必须坚持和完善中国特色社会主义制度，不断推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化，坚决破除一切不合时宜的思想观念和体制机制弊端，突破利益固化的藩篱，吸收人类文明有益成果，构建系统完备、科学规范、运行有效的制度体系，充分发挥我国社会主义制度优越性。 
Only with socialism can we save China; only with reform and opening can we develop China, develop socialism, and develop Marxism. We must uphold and improve the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and continue to modernize China’s system and capacity for governance. We must have the determination to get rid ofall outdated thinkingand ideas and all institutional ailments, and to break through the blockades of vested interests. We should draw on the achievements of other civilizations, develop a set of institutions that are well conceived, fully built, procedure based, and efficiently functioning, and do full justice to the strengths of China’s socialist system. 
（四）坚持新发展理念。 
Adopting a new vision for development 
发展是解决我国一切问题的基础和关键，发展必须是科学发展，必须坚定不移贯彻创新、协调、绿色、开放、共享的发展理念。必须坚持和完善我国社会主义基本经济制度和分配制度，毫不动摇巩固和发展公有制经济，毫不动摇鼓励、支持、引导非公有制经济发展，使市场在资源配置中起决定性作用，更好发挥政府作用，推动新型工业化、信息化、城镇化、农业现代化同步发展，主动参与和推动经济全球化进程，发展更高层次的开放型经济，不断壮大我国经济实力和综合国力。 
Development is the underpinning and the key for solving all our country’s problems; our development must be sound development. We must pursue with firmness of purpose the vision of innovative, coordinated, green, and open development that is for everyone. We must uphold and improve China’s basic socialist economic system and socialist distribution system. There must be no irresolution about working to consolidate and develop the public sector; and there must be no irresolution about working to encourage, support, and guide thedevelopment of the non-public sector. We must see that in resource allocation, the market plays the decisive role and the government plays its role better. We must see that new industrialization, IT application, urbanization, and agricultural modernization go hand in hand. Wemust actively participate in and promote economic globalization, develop an open economy of higher standards, and continue to increase China’s economic power and composite strength. 
（五）坚持人民当家作主。 
Seeing that the people run the country 
坚持党的领导、人民当家作主、依法治国有机统一是社会主义政治发展的必然要求。必须坚持中国特色社会主义政治发展道路，坚持和完善人民代表大会制度、中国共产党领导的多党合作和政治协商制度、民族区域自治制度、基层群众自治制度，巩固和发展最广泛的爱国统一战线，发展社会主义协商民主，健全民主制度，丰富民主形式，拓宽民主渠道，保证人民当家作主落实到国家政治生活和社会生活之中。 
Commitment to the organic unity of Party leadership, the people running the country, and law-based governance is a natural element of socialist political development. We must keep to the path of socialist political development with Chinese characteristics; uphold and improve the system of people’s congresses, the system of Party-led multiparty cooperation and political consultation, the system of regional ethnic autonomy, and the system of community-level self-governance; and consolidate and develop the broadest possible patriotic united front. We should develop socialist consultative democracy, improve our democratic institutions, diversify our forms of democracy, and establish more democratic channels. We must see to it that the principle of the people running the country is put into practice in China’s political and social activities. 
（六）坚持全面依法治国。 
Ensuring every dimension of governance is law-based 
全面依法治国是中国特色社会主义的本质要求和重要保障。必须把党的领导贯彻落实到依法治国全过程和各方面，坚定不移走中国特色社会主义法治道路，完善以宪法为核心的中国特色社会主义法律体系，建设中国特色社会主义法治体系，建设社会主义法治国家，发展中国特色社会主义法治理论，坚持依法治国、依法执政、依法行政共同推进，坚持法治国家、法治政府、法治社会一体建设，坚持依法治国和以德治国相结合，依法治国和依规治党有机统一，深化司法体制改革，提高全民族法治素养和道德素质。 
Law-based governance is an essential requirement and important guarantee for socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must exerciseParty leadership at every point in the process and over every dimension of law-based governance, and be fully committed to promoting socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics. We must improve the Chinese socialist system of laws, at the heart of which is the Constitution; establish a Chinese system of socialist rule of law; build a socialist country based on the rule of law; and develop Chinese socialist rule of law theory. We must pursue coordinated progress in law-based governance, law-based exercise of state power, and law-based government administration, and promote the integrated development of rule of law for the country, the government, and society. We must continue to promote a combination of rule of law and rule of virtue, and combine law-based governance of the country and rule-based governance over the Party. We must further the reform of the judicial system, and strengthen rule of law awareness among all our people while also enhancing their moral integrity. 
（七）坚持社会主义核心价值体系。 
Upholding core socialist values 
文化自信是一个国家、一个民族发展中更基本、更深沉、更持久的力量。必须坚持马克思主义，牢固树立共产主义远大理想和中国特色社会主义共同理想，培育和践行社会主义核心价值观，不断增强意识形态领域主导权和话语权，推动中华优秀传统文化创造性转化、创新性发展，继承革命文化，发展社会主义先进文化，不忘本来、吸收外来、面向未来，更好构筑中国精神、中国价值、中国力量，为人民提供精神指引。 
Cultural confidence represents a fundamental and profound force that sustains the development of acountry and a nation. We must uphold Marxism, firmup and furtherbuildtheidealof Communism and a shared ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and nurture and practice core socialist values, while making continued and greater efforts to maintain the initiative and ensure we have our say in the realm of ideology. We must promote the creative evolution and development of fine traditional Chinese culture, see our revolutionary culture remains alive and strong, and develop an advanced socialist culture. We should cherish our cultural roots, draw on other cultures, and be forward-thinking. We should do more to foster a Chinese spirit, Chinese values, and Chinese strength to provide a source of cultural and moral guidance for our people.
（八）坚持在发展中保障和改善民生。 
Ensuring and improving living standards through development 
增进民生福祉是发展的根本目的。必须多谋民生之利、多解民生之忧，在发展中补齐民生短板、促进社会公平正义，在幼有所育、学有所教、劳有所得、病有所医、老有所养、住有所居、弱有所扶上不断取得新进展，深入开展脱贫攻坚，保证全体人民在共建共享发展中有更多获得感，不断促进人的全面发展、全体人民共同富裕。建设平安中国，加强和创新社会治理，维护社会和谐稳定，确保国家长治久安、人民安居乐业。
The wellbeing of the people is the fundamental goal of development. We must do more to improve the livesandaddress the concerns of the people, and use development to strengthen areas of weakness and promote social fairness and justice. We should make steady progress in ensuring people’s access to childcare, education, employment, medical services, elderly care, housing, and social assistance. We will intensify poverty alleviation, see that all our people have agreatersenseoffulfillment as they contribute to and gain from development, and continue to promote well-rounded human development and common prosperity for everyone. We will continue the Peaceful China initiative, strengthen and develop new forms of social governance, and ensure social harmony and stability.We must work hard to see that our country enjoys enduring peace and stability andour people live and work in contentment.
（九）坚持人与自然和谐共生。 
Ensuring harmony between human and nature 
建设生态文明是中华民族永续发展的千年大计。必须树立和践行绿水青山就是金山银山的理念，坚持节约资源和保护环境的基本国策，像对待生命一样对待生态环境，统筹山水林田湖草系统治理，实行最严格的生态环境保护制度，形成绿色发展方式和生活方式，坚定走生产发展、生活富裕、生态良好的文明发展道路，建设美丽中国，为人民创造良好生产生活环境，为全球生态安全作出贡献。 
Building anecological civilization is vital to sustain theChinese nation’s development. We must realize that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets and act on this understanding, implement our fundamental national policy of conserving resources and protecting the environment, and cherish the environment as we cherish our own lives. We will adopt a holistic approach to conserving our mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes, and grasslands, implement the strictest possible systems for environmental protection, and develop eco-friendly growth models and ways of life. We must pursue a model of sustainable development featuring increased production, higher living standards, and healthy ecosystems. We must continue the Beautiful China initiative to create good working and living environments for our people and play our part in ensuring global ecological security.
（十）坚持总体国家安全观。 
Pursuing a holistic approach to national security 
统筹发展和安全，增强忧患意识，做到居安思危，是我们党治国理政的一个重大原则。必须坚持国家利益至上，以人民安全为宗旨，以政治安全为根本，统筹外部安全和内部安全、国土安全和国民安全、传统安全和非传统安全、自身安全和共同安全，完善国家安全制度体系，加强国家安全能力建设，坚决维护国家主权、安全、发展利益。
We should ensure both development and security and be ever ready to protect against potential dangers in time of peace. This is a major principle underlying the Party’s governance. We must put national interests first, take protecting our people’s security as our mission and safeguarding political security as a fundamental task, and ensure both internal and external security, homeland and public security, traditional and non-traditional security, and China’s own and common security. We will improve our systems and institutions and enhance capacity-building for national security, and resolutely safeguard China’s sovereignty, security, and development interests. 
（十一）坚持党对人民军队的绝对领导。 
Upholding absolute Party leadership over the people’s forces 
建设一支听党指挥、能打胜仗、作风优良的人民军队，是实现 “两个一百年”奋斗目标、实现中华民族伟大复兴的战略支撑。必须全面贯彻党领导人民军队的一系列根本原则和制度，确立新时代党的强军思想在国防和军队建设中的指导地位，坚持政治建军、改革强军、科技兴军、依法治军，更加注重聚焦实战，更加注重创新驱动，更加注重体系建设，更加注重集约高效，更加注重军民融合，实现党在新时代的强军目标。 
Building people’s forces that obey the Party’s command, can fight and win, and maintain excellent conduct is strategically important to achieving the two centenary goals1 and national rejuvenation. To realize the Party’s goal of building a powerful military in the new era, we must fully implement the fundamental principles and systems of Party leadership over the military, and see that Party strategy on strengthening military capabilities for the new era guides work to build national defense and the armed forces. We must continue to enhance the political loyalty of the armed forces, strengthen themthrough reformand technology, and run them in accordance with law. We must place greater focus on combat, encourage innovation, build systems, increase efficacy and efficiency, and further military-civilian integration.
（十二）坚持“一国两制”和推进祖国统一。 
Upholding the principle of “one country, two systems” and promoting national reunification 
保持香港、澳门长期繁荣稳定，实现祖国完全统一，是实现中华民族伟大复兴的必然要求。必须把维护中央对香港、澳门特别行政区全面管治权和保障特别行政区高度自治权有机结合起来，确保 “一国两制”方针不会变、不动摇，确保 “一国两制”实践不变形、不走样。必须坚持一个中国原则，坚持 “九二共识”，推动两岸关系和平发展，深化两岸经济合作和文化往来，推动两岸同胞共同反对一切分裂国家的活动，共同为实现中华民族伟大复兴而奋斗。
Maintaining lasting prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao and achieving China’s full reunification are essential to realizing national rejuvenation. We must ensure both the central government’s overall jurisdiction over the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions and a high degree of autonomy in the two regions. We should ensure that the principle of “one country, two systems” remains unchanged, is unwaveringly upheld, and in practice is not bent or distorted. We must uphold the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus, promote the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, deepen economic cooperation and cultural exchange between the two sides of the Straits, and encourage fellow Chinese on both sides to oppose all separatist activities and work together to realize Chinese national rejuvenation. 
（十三）坚持推动构建人类命运共同体。 
Promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind 
中国人民的梦想同各国人民的梦想息息相通，实现中国梦离不开和平的国际环境和稳定的国际秩序。必须统筹国内国际两个大局，始终不渝走和平发展道路、奉行互利共赢的开放战略，坚持正确义利观，树立共同、综合、合作、可持续的新安全观，谋求开放创新、包容互惠的发展前景，促进和而不同、兼收并蓄的文明交流，构筑尊崇自然、绿色发展的生态体系，始终做世界和平的建设者、全球发展的贡献者、国际秩序的维护者。 
The dream of the Chinese people is closely connected with the dreams of the peoples of other countries; the Chinese Dream can be realized only in a peaceful international environment and under a stable international order. We must keep in mind both our internal andinternational imperatives, stay on the pathof peaceful development, andcontinue topursue a mutually beneficial strategy of opening up. We will uphold justice while pursuing shared interests, and will foster new thinking on common, comprehensive, cooperative, andsustainable security.We will pursue open, innovative, and inclusive development that benefits everyone; boost cross-cultural exchanges characterized by harmony within diversity, inclusiveness, and mutual learning; andcultivate ecosystems based on respect for nature and green development. China will continue its efforts to safeguard world peace, contribute to global development, and uphold international order. 
十四、坚持全面从严治党。 
Exercising full and rigorous governance over the Party 
勇于自我革命，从严管党治党，是我们党最鲜明的品格。必须以党章为根本遵循，把党的政治建设摆在首位，思想建党和制度治党同向发力，统筹推进党的各项建设，抓住“关键少数”，坚持“三严三实”，坚持民主集中制，严肃党内政治生活，严明党的纪律，强化党内监督，发展积极健康的党内政治文化，全面净化党内政治生态，坚决纠正各种不正之风，以零容忍态度惩治腐败，不断增强党自我净化、自我完善、自我革新、自我提高的能力，始终保持党同人民群众的血肉联系。 
To have the courage to carry out self-reform and conduct strict self-governance: this is the most distinctive part of our Party’s good character. We must uphold the Party Constitution as our fundamental rules, give top priority to the political work of the Party, combine efforts on ideological work and institution building, and strengthen Party competence in all respects. We must focus on oversight over the “key few,” by which we mean leading officials, and seethat the principle of Three Stricts and Three Earnests areobserved. Wemustuphold democratic centralism,ensure that intraparty political activities are carried out in earnest, impose strict Party discipline, and strengthen internal oversight. We must develop a positiveand healthypoliticalculture in the Party and improve the Party’s political ecosystem, resolutely correct misconduct in all its forms, and show zero tolerance for corruption. We will continue to strengthen the Party’sability to purify, improve, and reformitself, and forever maintain its close ties with the people. 
以上十四条，构成新时代坚持和发展中国特色社会主义的基本方略。全党同志必须全面贯彻党的基本理论、基本路线、基本方略，更好引领党和人民事业发展。 
The above 14 points form the basic policy that underpins our endeavors to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. All our members must fully implement the Party’s basic theory, line, and policy so as to better steer the development of the Party and people’s cause.
实践没有止境，理论创新也没有止境。世界每时每刻都在发生变化，中国也每时每刻都在发生变化，我们必须在理论上跟上时代，不断认识规律，不断推进理论创新、实践创新、制度创新、文化创新以及其他各方面创新。 
Just as there are no bounds to practice, there is no end to theoretical exploration. The world is changing with every second, every moment; and China, too, is changing with every second, every moment. We must ensure our theory evolves with the times, deepen our appreciation of objective laws, and advance our theoretical, practical, institutional, cultural, and other explorations. 
同志们！ 
Comrades, 
时代是思想之母，实践是理论之源。只要我们善于聆听时代声音，勇于坚持真理、修正错误，二十一世纪中国的马克思主义一定能够展现出更强大、更有说服力的真理力量！
The era is the mother of thought; practice is the fount of theory. If we respond to the call of our times and have the courage to uphold truth and correct errors, the Marxismof21st century China will, without a doubt, emanate more mighty, more compelling power of truth. 
四、决胜全面建成小康社会，开启全面建设社会主义现代化国家新征程 
Securing a Decisive Victory in Building a Moderately Prosperous Society in All Respects and Embarking on a Journey to Fully Build a Modern Socialist China 
改革开放之后，我们党对我国社会主义现代化建设作出战略安排，提出 “三步走”战略目标。解决人民温饱问题、人民生活总体上达到小康水平这两个目标已提前实现。在这个基础上，我们党提出，到建党一百年时建成经济更加发展、民主更加健全、科教更加进步、文化更加繁荣、社会更加和谐、人民生活更加殷实的小康社会，然后再奋斗三十年，到新中国成立一百年时，基本实现现代化，把我国建成社会主义现代化国家。 
After adopting the policy of reform and opening up, our Party laid out three strategic goals for achieving socialist modernization in China. The first two —ensuring that people’s basic needs are met and that their lives are generally decent—have been accomplished ahead of time. Building on this, our Party then developed the vision that by the time we, the Party, celebrate our centenary, we will have developed oursociety into a moderately prosperousone with a stronger economy, greater democracy, more advanced science and education, thriving culture, greater social harmony, and a better quality of life. After this, with another 30 years of work, and by the time we celebrate the centenary of the People’s Republic of China, we will have basically achieved modernization and turned China into a modern socialist country. 
从现在到二〇二〇年，是全面建成小康社会决胜期。要按照十六大、十七大、十八大提出的全面建成小康社会各项要求，紧扣我国社会主要矛盾变化，统筹推进经济建设、政治建设、文化建设、社会建设、生态文明建设，坚定实施科教兴国战略、人才强国战略、创新驱动发展战略、乡村振兴战略、区域协调发展战略、可持续发展战略、军民融合发展战略，突出抓重点、补短板、强弱项，特别是要坚决打好防范化解重大风险、精准脱贫、污染防治的攻坚战，使全面建成小康社会得到人民认可、经得起历史检验。 
The period between now and 2020 will be decisive in finishing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects. We must follow the requirements on buildingthis society set out at our 16th, 17th and 18th National Congresses, act in response to the evolution of the principal contradiction in Chinese society, and promote coordinated economic, political, cultural, social, and ecological advancement. We must show firm resolve in implementing the strategy for invigorating China through science and education, the strategy on developing a quality workforce, the innovation-driven development strategy, the rural vitalization strategy, the coordinated regional development strategy, the sustainable development strategy, and the military-civilian integration strategy. We must focus on priorities, address inadequacies, and shore up points of weakness. In this regard, I want to stress that we must take tough steps to forestall and defuse major risks, carry out targeted poverty alleviation, and prevent and control pollution, so that the moderately prosperous society we build earns the people’s approval and stands the test of time. 
从十九大到二十大，是 “两个一百年”奋斗目标的历史交汇期。我们既要全面建成小康社会、实现第一个百年奋斗目标，又要乘势而上开启全面建设社会主义现代化国家新征程，向第二个百年奋斗目标进军。 
The period between the 19th and the 20th National Congress is the period in which the timeframes of the two centenary goals converge. In this period, not only must we finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and achieve the first centenary goal; we must also build on this achievement to embark on a new journey toward the second centenary goal of fully building a modern socialist country.
综合分析国际国内形势和我国发展条件，从二〇二〇年到本世纪中叶可以分两个阶段来安排。 
Based on a comprehensive analysis of the international and domestic environments and the conditions for China’s development, we have drawn up a two-stage development plan for the period from 2020 to the middle of this century. 
第一个阶段，从二〇二〇年到二〇三五年，在全面建成小康社会的基础上，再奋斗十五年，基本实现社会主义现代化。到那时，我国经济实力、科技实力将大幅跃升，跻身创新型国家前列；人民平等参与、平等发展权利得到充分保障，法治国家、法治政府、法治社会基本建成，各方面制度更加完善，国家治理体系和治理能力现代化基本实现；社会文明程度达到新的高度，国家文化软实力显著增强，中华文化影响更加广泛深入；人民生活更为宽裕，中等收入群体比例明显提高，城乡区域发展差距和居民生活水平差距显著缩小，基本公共服务均等化基本实现，全体人民共同富裕迈出坚实步伐；现代社会治理格局基本形成，社会充满活力又和谐有序；生态环境根本好转，美丽中国目标基本实现。 
In the first stage from 2020 to 2035, we will build on the foundation created by the moderately prosperous society with a further 15 years of hard work to see that socialist modernization is basically realized. The vision is that by the end of this stage, the following goals will have been met: China’s economic and technological strength has increased significantly. China has become aglobal leader in innovation. The rights of the people to participate and to develop as equals are adequately protected. The rule of law for the country, the government, and society is basically in place. Institutions in all fields are further improved; the modernization of China’s system and capacity for governance is basically achieved. Social etiquette and civility are significantly enhanced. China’s cultural soft power has grown much stronger; Chinese culture has greater appeal. People are leading more comfortable lives, and the size of the middle-income group has grown considerably. Disparities in urban-rural development, in development between regions, and in living standards are significantly reduced; equitable access to basic public services is basically ensured; and solid progress has been made toward prosperity for everyone. A modern social governance system has basically taken shape, and society is full of vitality, harmonious, and orderly. There is a fundamental improvement in the environment; the goal of building a Beautiful China is basically attained. 
第二个阶段，从二〇三五年到本世纪中叶，在基本实现现代化的基础上，再奋斗十五年，把我国建成富强民主文明和谐美丽的社会主义现代化强国。到那时，我国物质文明、政治文明、精神文明、社会文明、生态文明将全面提升，实现国家治理体系和治理能力现代化，成为综合国力和国际影响力领先的国家，全体人民共同富裕基本实现，我国人民将享有更加幸福安康的生活，中华民族将以更加昂扬的姿态屹立于世界民族之林。 
In the second stage from 2035 to the middle of the 21st century, we will, building on having basically achieved modernization, work hard for a further 15 years and develop China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious, and beautiful. By the end of this stage, the following goals will have been met: New heights are reached in every dimension of material, political, cultural and ethical, social, and ecological advancement. Modernization of China’s systemand capacity for governance is achieved. China has becomeaglobal leader in terms of composite national strength and international influence. Common prosperity for everyone is basically achieved. The Chinese people enjoy happier, safer, and healthier lives. The Chinese nation will become a proud and active member of the community of nations. 
同志们！ 
Comrades, 
从全面建成小康社会到基本实现现代化，再到全面建成社会主义现代化强国，是新时代中国特色社会主义发展的战略安排。我们要坚忍不拔、锲而不舍，奋力谱写社会主义现代化新征程的壮丽篇章！
This is our strategic vision for developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era: Finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, proceed to basically realize modernization, and then move on to turn China into a great modern socialist country in every dimension. We must work with resolve and tenacity and write a brilliant chapter on our new journey to socialist modernization. 
五、贯彻新发展理念，建设现代化经济体系 
Applying a New Vision of Development and Developing a Modernized Economy 
实现“两个一百年”奋斗目标、实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦，不断提高人民生活水平，必须坚定不移把发展作为党执政兴国的第一要务，坚持解放和发展社会生产力，坚持社会主义市场经济改革方向，推动经济持续健康发展。 
To deliver on the two centenary goals, realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation, and steadily improve our people’s lives, we must continue to pursuedevelopment as the Party’s top priority in governance; we must unleash and develop productive forces, continue reforms to develop the socialist market economy, and promote sustained and sound economic growth. 
我国经济已由高速增长阶段转向高质量发展阶段，正处在转变发展方式、优化经济结构、转换增长动力的攻关期，建设现代化经济体系是跨越关口的迫切要求和我国发展的战略目标。必须坚持质量第一、效益优先，以供给侧结构性改革为主线，推动经济发展质量变革、效率变革、动力变革，提高全要素生产率，着力加快建设实体经济、科技创新、现代金融、人力资源协同发展的产业体系，着力构建市场机制有效、微观主体有活力、宏观调控有度的经济体制，不断增强我国经济创新力和竞争力。 
China’s economy has been transitioning from a phase of rapid growth to a stage of high-quality development. This is a pivotal stage for transforming our growth model, improving our economic structure, and fostering new drivers of growth. It is imperative that we develop a modernized economy. This is both an urgent requirement for getting us smoothly through this critical transition and a strategic goal for China’s development. We must put quality first and give priority to performance. We should pursue supply-side structural reform as our main task, and work hard for better quality, higher efficiency, and more robust drivers of economic growth through reform. We need to raise total factor productivity and accelerate the building of an industrial systemthat promotes coordinated development of the real economy with technological innovation, modern finance, and human resources. We should endeavor to develop an economy with more effective market mechanisms, dynamic micro-entities, and sound macro-regulation. This will steadily strengthen the innovation capacity and competitiveness of China’s economy. 
（一）深化供给侧结构性改革。 
Furthering supply-side structural reform 
建设现代化经济体系，必须把发展经济的着力点放在实体经济上，把提高供给体系质量作为主攻方向，显著增强我国经济质量优势。加快建设制造强国，加快发展先进制造业，推动互联网、大数据、人工智能和实体经济深度融合，在中高端消费、创新引领、绿色低碳、共享经济、现代供应链、人力资本服务等领域培育新增长点、形成新动能。支持传统产业优化升级，加快发展现代服务业，瞄准国际标准提高水平。促进我国产业迈向全球价值链中高端，培育若干世界级先进制造业集群。加强水利、铁路、公路、水运、航空、管道、电网、信息、物流等基础设施网络建设。坚持去产能、去库存、去杠杆、降成本、补短板，优化存量资源配置，扩大优质增量供给，实现供需动态平衡。激发和保护企业家精神，鼓励更多社会主体投身创新创业。建设知识型、技能型、创新型劳动者大军，弘扬劳模精神和工匠精神，营造劳动光荣的社会风尚和精益求精的敬业风气。 
In developing a modernized economy, we must focus on the real economy, give priority to improving the quality of the supply system, and enhance our economy’s strength in terms of quality. We will work faster to build China into a manufacturer ofquality and develop advanced manufacturing, promote further integration of the internet, big data, and artificial intelligence with the real economy, and foster new growth areas and drivers of growth in medium-high end consumption, innovation-driven development, the green and low-carbon economy, the sharing economy, modern supply chains, and human capital services. We will support traditional industries in upgrading themselves and accelerate development of modern service industries to elevate them to international standards. We will move Chinese industries up to themedium-high end of the global value chain, and foster anumber of world-class advanced manufacturing clusters.We will strengthen infrastructure networks for water conservancy, railways, highways, waterways, aviation, pipelines, power grids, information, and logistics. We will continue efforts to cut overcapacity, reduceexcess inventory, deleverage, lower costs, and strengthen areas of weakness, and work to achieve adynamicbalance between supply and demand by improving the allocation of available resources and increasing high-quality supply.We will inspire and protect entrepreneurship, and encourage more entities to make innovations and start businesses. We will build an educated, skilled, and innovative workforce, foster respect for model workers, promote quality workmanship, and see that taking pride in labor becomes a social norm and seeking excellence is valued as a good work ethic. 
（二）加快建设创新型国家。 
Making China a country of innovators 
创新是引领发展的第一动力，是建设现代化经济体系的战略支撑。 
Innovation is the primary force driving development; it is the strategic underpinning for building a modernized economy. 
要瞄准世界科技前沿，强化基础研究，实现前瞻性基础研究、引领性原创成果重大突破。加强应用基础研究，拓展实施国家重大科技项目，突出关键共性技术、前沿引领技术、现代工程技术、颠覆性技术创新，为建设科技强国、质量强国、航天强国、网络强国、交通强国、数字中国、智慧社会提供有力支撑。加强国家创新体系建设，强化战略科技力量。深化科技体制改革，建立以企业为主体、市场为导向、产学研深度融合的技术创新体系，加强对中小企业创新的支持，促进科技成果转化。倡导创新文化，强化知识产权创造、保护、运用。培养造就一大批具有国际水平的战略科技人才、科技领军人才、青年科技人才和高水平创新团队。 
We should aim to reach frontier areas of science and technology, strengthen basic research, and make major breakthroughs in pioneering basic research and path-breaking and original innovations. We will strengthen basic research in applied sciences, launch major national science and technology projects, and prioritize innovation in key generic technologies, cutting-edge frontier technologies, modern engineering technologies, and disruptive technologies. These efforts will provide powerful support for building China’s strength in science and technology, product quality, aerospace, cyberspace, and transportation; and for buildinga digital China and a smart society. We will improve our national innovation system and boost our strategic scientific and technological strength. We will further reform the management system for science and technology, and develop a market-oriented system for technological innovation in which enterprises are the main players and synergy is created through the joint efforts of enterprises, universities, and research institutes. We will support innovation by small and medium-sized enterprises and encourage the application of advances in science and technology. 
We will foster a culture of innovation, and strengthen the creation, protection, and application of intellectual property. We should cultivate a large number of world-class scientists and technologists in strategicallyimportant fields, scientific andtechnological leaders, and young scientists and engineers, as well as high-performing innovation teams. 
（三）实施乡村振兴战略。 
Pursuing a rural vitalization strategy 
农业农村农民问题是关系国计民生的根本性问题，必须始终把解决好 “三农”问题作为全党工作重中之重。要坚持农业农村优先发展，按照产业兴旺、生态宜居、乡风文明、治理有效、生活富裕的总要求，建立健全城乡融合发展体制机制和政策体系，加快推进农业农村现代化。巩固和完善农村基本经营制度，深化农村土地制度改革，完善承包地 “三权”分置制度。保持土地承包关系稳定并长久不变，第二轮土地承包到期后再延长三十年。深化农村集体产权制度改革，保障农民财产权益，壮大集体经济。确保国家粮食安全，把中国人的饭碗牢牢端在自己手中。构建现代农业产业体系、生产体系、经营体系，完善农业支持保护制度，发展多种形式适度规模经营，培育新型农业经营主体，健全农业社会化服务体系，实现小农户和现代农业发展有机衔接。促进农村一二三产业融合发展，支持和鼓励农民就业创业，拓宽增收渠道。加强农村基层基础工作，健全自治、法治、德治相结合的乡村治理体系。培养造就一支懂农业、爱农村、爱农民的“三农”工作队伍。 
Issues relating to agriculture, rural areas, and rural people are fundamental to China as they directly concern our country’s stability and our people’s wellbeing. Addressing these issues should have a central place on the work agenda of the Party, and we must prioritize the development of agriculture and rural areas. To build rural areas with thrivingbusinesses, pleasant living environments, social etiquette and civility, effective governance, and prosperity, we need to put in place sound systems, mechanisms, and policies for promoting integrated urban-rural development, and speed up the modernization of agriculture and rural areas. We will consolidate and improve the basic rural operation system, advance reformof the rural land system, and improve the systemfor separating the ownership rights, contract rights, and management rights for contracted rural land. Rural land contracting practices will remain stable and unchanged on a long-term basis; the current round of contracts will be extended for another 30 years upon expiration. We will press ahead with reform of the rural collective property rights system, safeguard the property rights and interests of rural people, and strengthen the collective economy. We must ensure China’s food security so that we always have control over our own food supply. We will establish industrial, production, and business operation systems for modern agriculture, and improve the systems for supporting and protecting agriculture. We will develop appropriately scaled agricultural operations of various forms, cultivate new types of agribusiness, improve specialized agricultural services, and encourage small household farmers to become involved in modern agriculture. We will promote the integrated development of the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries in rural areas, support and encourage employment and business startups there, and open up morechannels to increase rural incomes. We will strengthen basic services in rural communities, andimprove the governance model in ruralareas based on a combination of self-governance, rule of law, and rule of virtue. Wewill train professional rural service personnel who have a good knowledge of agriculture, love our rural areas, and care about rural people. 
（四）实施区域协调发展战略。 
Implementing the coordinated regional development strategy 
加大力度支持革命老区、民族地区、边疆地区、贫困地区加快发展，强化举措推进西部大开发形成新格局，深化改革加快东北等老工业基地振兴，发挥优势推动中部地区崛起，创新引领率先实现东部地区优化发展，建立更加有效的区域协调发展新机制。以城市群为主体构建大中小城市和小城镇协调发展的城镇格局，加快农业转移人口市民化。以疏解北京非首都功能为 “牛鼻子”推动京津冀协同发展，高起点规划、高标准建设雄安新区。以共抓大保护、不搞大开发为导向推动长江经济带发展。支持资源型地区经济转型发展。加快边疆发展，确保边疆巩固、边境安全。坚持陆海统筹，加快建设海洋强国。 
We will devote more energy to speeding up the development of old revolutionary base areas, areas with large ethnic minority populations, border areas, andpoor areas. We will strengthen measures to reach anew stage in the large-scale development of the western region; deepen reform to accelerate the revitalization of old industrial bases in the northeast andother parts of the country; help the central region rise by tapping into local strengths; and support the eastern region in taking the lead in pursuing optimal development through innovation. To this end, we need to put in place new, effective mechanismsto ensure coordinated development of different regions. We will create networks ofcities and towns based on city clusters,enabling the coordinated development of cities of different sizes and small towns, and speed up work on granting permanent urban residency to people who move from rural to urban areas. We will relieve Beijing of functions nonessential to its role as the capital and use this effort to drive the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region; and we will develop forward-looking plans and adopt high standards for building the Xiongan New Area. We will facilitate the development of the Yangtze Economic Belt by promoting well-coordinated environmental conservation and avoiding excessive development. Support will be given to resource-depleted areas in their economic transformation. We will accelerate development in the border areas, and ensure their stability and security. 
We will pursue coordinated land and marine development, and step up efforts to build China into a strong maritime country. 
（五）加快完善社会主义市场经济体制。 
Accelerating efforts to improve the socialist market economy 
经济体制改革必须以完善产权制度和要素市场化配置为重点，实现产权有效激励、要素自由流动、价格反应灵活、竞争公平有序、企业优胜劣汰。要完善各类国有资产管理体制，改革国有资本授权经营体制，加快国有经济布局优化、结构调整、战略性重组，促进国有资产保值增值，推动国有资本做强做优做大，有效防止国有资产流失。深化国有企业改革，发展混合所有制经济，培育具有全球竞争力的世界一流企业。 
In our economic reforms, we must concentrate on improving the property rights system and ensuring the market-based allocation of factors of production, so that property rights act as effective incentives, and we should ensure free flows of factors, flexible prices, fair and orderly competition, and that business survival is determined by competition. 
全面实施市场准入负面清单制度，清理废除妨碍统一市场和公平竞争的各种规定和做法，支持民营企业发展，激发各类市场主体活力。 
We will improve the systems for managing different types of state assets, and reformthe system of authorized operation of state capital. In the state-owned sector, we will step up improved distribution, structural adjustment, and strategic reorganization. We will work to see that state assets maintain and increase their value; we will support state capital in becoming stronger, doing better, and growing bigger, and take effective measures to prevent the loss of state assets. We will further reform ofstate-owned enterprises, develop mixed-ownership economic entities, and turn Chinese enterprises into world-class, globally competitive firms. We will introduce anegative list for market access nationwide, sort through and do away with regulations and practices that impede the development of a unified market and fair competition, support the growth of private businesses, and stimulate the vitality of various market entities. 
深化商事制度改革，打破行政性垄断，防止市场垄断，加快要素价格市场化改革，放宽服务业准入限制，完善市场监管体制。创新和完善宏观调控，发挥国家发展规划的战略导向作用，健全财政、货币、产业、区域等经济政策协调机制。 
We will deepen reforms in the business sector, break administrative monopolies, preclude the forming of market monopolies, speed up the reformof market-based pricing of factors of production, relax control over market access in the service sector, and improve market oversight mechanisms. We will develop new methods to improve macro-regulation, give full play to the strategic guidance of national development plans, and improve mechanisms for coordinating fiscal, monetary, industrial, regional, and other economic policies. 
完善促进消费的体制机制，增强消费对经济发展的基础性作用。深化投融资体制改革，发挥投资对优化供给结构的关键性作用。加快建立现代财政制度，建立权责清晰、财力协调、区域均衡的中央和地方财政关系。建立全面规范透明、标准科学、约束有力的预算制度，全面实施绩效管理。 
We will improve systems and mechanisms for stimulating consumer spending, and leverage the fundamental role of consumption in promoting economic growth. We will deepen reform of the investment and financing systems,and enable investment to playacrucial role in improving the supply structure. We will expedite the creation of a modern public finance system, and establish a fiscal relationship between the central and local governments built upon clearly defined powers and responsibilities, appropriate financial resource allocation, and greater balance between regions. We will put in place a comprehensive, procedure-based, transparent budget system that uses well-conceived standards and imposes effective constraints; and we will implement performance-based management nationwide. 
深化税收制度改革，健全地方税体系。深化金融体制改革，增强金融服务实体经济能力，提高直接融资比重，促进多层次资本市场健康发展。健全货币政策和宏观审慎政策双支柱调控框架，深化利率和汇率市场化改革。健全金融监管体系，守住不发生系统性金融风险的底线。 
We will deepen reform ofthe taxation system, and improve the local tax system. We will deepen institutional reform in the financial sector, make it better serve the real economy, increase the proportion of direct financing, and promote the healthy development of a multilevel capital market. We will improve the framework of regulation underpinned by monetary policy and macro-prudential policy, and see that interest rates andexchange rates become more market-based. We will improve the financial regulatory system to forestall systemic financial risks. 
（六）推动形成全面开放新格局。 
Making new ground in pursuing opening up on all fronts 
开放带来进步，封闭必然落后。中国开放的大门不会关闭，只会越开越大。要以“一带一路”建设为重点，坚持引进来和走出去并重，遵循共商共建共享原则，加强创新能力开放合作，形成陆海内外联动、东西双向互济的开放格局。拓展对外贸易，培育贸易新业态新模式，推进贸易强国建设。实行高水平的贸易和投资自由化便利化政策，全面实行准入前国民待遇加负面清单管理制度，大幅度放宽市场准入，扩大服务业对外开放，保护外商投资合法权益。凡是在我国境内注册的企业，都要一视同仁、平等对待。优化区域开放布局，加大西部开放力度。赋予自由贸易试验区更大改革自主权，探索建设自由贸易港。创新对外投资方式，促进国际产能合作，形成面向全球的贸易、投融资、生产、服务网络，加快培育国际经济合作和竞争新优势。 
Openness brings progress, whileself-seclusion leaves one behind. China will not close its door to the world; we will only become more and more open. We should pursue the Belt and Road Initiative as apriority, give equal emphasis to “bringing in” and “going global,” follow the principle of achieving shared growth through discussion and collaboration, and increase openness and cooperation in building innovation capacity. With these efforts, we hope to make new ground in opening China further through links running eastward and westward, across land and over sea. We will expand foreign trade, develop new models and new forms of trade, and turn China into a trader of quality. We will adopt policies to promote high-standard liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment; we will implement the system of pre-establishment national treatment plus a negative list across the board, significantly ease market access, further open the service sector, and protect thelegitimate rights and interests of foreign investors. All businesses registered in China will be treated equally. We will improve the balance in opening our different regions, and open the western region wider. We will grant more powers to pilot free trade zones to conduct reform, and explore the opening of free trade ports. We will develop new ways of making outbound investments, promote international cooperation on production capacity, form globally-oriented networks of trade, investment and financing, production, and services, and build up our strengths for international economic cooperation and competition.
同志们！ 
Comrades, 
解放和发展社会生产力，是社会主义的本质要求。我们要激发全社会创造力和发展活力，努力实现更高质量、更有效率、更加公平、更可持续的发展！ 
Unlocking and developing the productive forces is a fundamental task of socialism. We must inspire creativity and vitality throughout society, and strive to achieve better quality, more efficient, fairer, and more sustainable development. 
六、健全人民当家作主制度体系，发展社会主义民主政治 
Improving the Systemof Institutionsthrough Which the People Run the Country and Developing Socialist Democracy 
我国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的社会主义国家，国家一切权力属于人民。我国社会主义民主是维护人民根本利益的最广泛、最真实、最管用的民主。发展社会主义民主政治就是要体现人民意志、保障人民权益、激发人民创造活力，用制度体系保证人民当家作主。 
China is a socialist country of people’s democratic dictatorship under the leadership of the working class based on an alliance of workers and farmers;it isacountry where all powerof the state belongs to the people. China’s socialist democracy is the broadest, most genuine, and most effective democracy to safeguard the fundamental interests of the people. The very purpose of developing socialist democracy is to givefull expressiontothe will ofthepeople, protect theirrights andinterests, spark their creativity, and provide systemic and institutional guarantees to ensure the people run the country. 
中国特色社会主义政治发展道路，是近代以来中国人民长期奋斗历史逻辑、理论逻辑、实践逻辑的必然结果，是坚持党的本质属性、践行党的根本宗旨的必然要求。 
The path ofsocialist politicaldevelopment with Chinese characteristics is the logical outcome of the evolution of history, theory, and practice as the Chinese people have long engaged in struggles since the advent of modern times. It is a requisite for maintaining the very nature of the Party and fulfilling its fundamental purpose.
世界上没有完全相同的政治制度模式，政治制度不能脱离特定社会政治条件和历史文化传统来抽象评判，不能定于一尊，不能生搬硬套外国政治制度模式。 
No two political systems are entirely the same, and a political system cannot be judged in abstraction without regard for its social and political context, its history, and its cultural traditions.No one political systemshould be regarded as the only choice; and we should not just mechanically copy the political systems of other countries. 
要长期坚持、不断发展我国社会主义民主政治，积极稳妥推进政治体制改革，推进社会主义民主政治制度化、规范化、法治化、程序化，保证人民依法通过各种途径和形式管理国家事务，管理经济文化事业，管理社会事务，巩固和发展生动活泼、安定团结的政治局面。 
We must uphold long term and steadily strengthen China’s socialist democracy, make active and prudent efforts to advance the reform of the political system, and improve the institutions, standards, and procedures of socialist democracy. We should ensure that people participate, in accordance with law and in various ways and forms, in the management of state, economic, cultural, and social affairs, and consolidate and enhance political stability, unity, and vitality. 
（一）坚持党的领导、人民当家作主、依法治国有机统一。 
Upholding the unity of Party leadership, the people running the country, and law-based governance 
党的领导是人民当家作主和依法治国的根本保证，人民当家作主是社会主义民主政治的本质特征，依法治国是党领导人民治理国家的基本方式，三者统一于我国社会主义民主政治伟大实践。在我国政治生活中，党是居于领导地位的，加强党的集中统一领导，支持人大、政府、政协和法院、检察院依法依章程履行职能、开展工作、发挥作用，这两个方面是统一的。 
Party leadership is the fundamental guarantee for ensuring that the people run the country and governance in China is law-based; that the people run the country is an essential feature of socialist democracy; and law-based governance is the basic way for the Party to lead the people in governing the country. These three elements are integral components of socialist democracy. InChina’s political life, our Party exercises leadership. Strengthening the centralized, unified leadership of the Party on the one hand and, on the other, supporting the people’s congresses, governments, committees of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), courts, and procuratorates in performing their functions and playing their roles in accordance with the law and their charters, form a unified pair. 
要改进党的领导方式和执政方式，保证党领导人民有效治理国家；扩大人民有序政治参与，保证人民依法实行民主选举、民主协商、民主决策、民主管理、民主监督；维护国家法制统一、尊严、权威，加强人权法治保障，保证人民依法享有广泛权利和自由。巩固基层政权，完善基层民主制度，保障人民知情权、参与权、表达权、监督权。健全依法决策机制，构建决策科学、执行坚决、监督有力的权力运行机制。各级领导干部要增强民主意识，发扬民主作风，接受人民监督，当好人民公仆。 
We will improve theway the Party exercises leadership and governance to ensure that it leads the people in effectively governing the country. We will expand thepeople’s orderly political participation to see that inaccordance with law they engage in democratic elections, consultations, decision-making, management, and oversight. We should uphold the unity, sanctity, and authority of China’s legal system, and strengthen legal protection for human rights to ensure that the people enjoy extensive rights and freedoms as prescribed by law. We should both consolidate government and improve the institutions of democracy at the primary level to ensure the people’s rights to be informed, toparticipate, to be heard, and to oversee. We will improve mechanisms for law-based decision-making, and put in place mechanisms for the exercise of power that ensure sound decision-making, resolute execution, and effective oversight. Officials at all levels must deepen their understanding of democracy, be democratic in their conduct, willingly accept public oversight,and perform as they should in their role as public servants. 
（二）加强人民当家作主制度保障。 
Strengthening institutional guarantees to ensure the people run the country 
人民代表大会制度是坚持党的领导、人民当家作主、依法治国有机统一的根本政治制度安排，必须长期坚持、不断完善。要支持和保证人民通过人民代表大会行使国家权力。发挥人大及其常委会在立法工作中的主导作用，健全人大组织制度和工作制度，支持和保证人大依法行使立法权、监督权、决定权、任免权，更好发挥人大代表作用，使各级人大及其常委会成为全面担负起宪法法律赋予的各项职责的工作机关，成为同人民群众保持密切联系的代表机关。完善人大专门委员会设置，优化人大常委会和专门委员会组成人员结构。 
We must uphold long term and steadily improve the system of people’s congresses, a political system fundamental to the Party’s leadership, the people’s running of the country, and law-based governance. We should support and ensure the people’s exercise of state power through people’s congresses. We should see to it that people’s congresses and their standing committees play the leading role in lawmaking, and improve the organizational and working systems of people’s congresses to support and ensure the exercise of their statutory powers of enacting laws, conducting oversight, making decisions, and appointing and removing officials. We should give better play to the role of deputies to people’s congresses, and enable people’s congresses at all levels and their standing committees to fully perform their functions as stipulated in the Constitution and the law, and to truly represent the people and maintain close ties with them. We should improve the setup of special committees of people’s congresses and the composition of their standing committees and special committees. 
（三）发挥社会主义协商民主重要作用。 
Giving play to the important role of socialist consultative democracy 
有事好商量，众人的事情由众人商量，是人民民主的真谛。协商民主是实现党的领导的重要方式，是我国社会主义民主政治的特有形式和独特优势。要推动协商民主广泛、多层、制度化发展，统筹推进政党协商、人大协商、政府协商、政协协商、人民团体协商、基层协商以及社会组织协商。加强协商民主制度建设，形成完整的制度程序和参与实践，保证人民在日常政治生活中有广泛持续深入参与的权利。
The essence of the people’s democracy is that the people get to discuss their own affairs. Consultative democracy is an important way of effecting Party leadership and a model and strength unique to China’s socialist democracy. We will advance extensive, multilevel, and institutionalized development of consultative democracy, and adopt a coordinated approach to promoting consultations carried out by political parties, people’s congresses, government departments, CPPCC committees, people’s organizations, communities, and social organizations. We will strengthen the institutions of consultative democracy and develop complete procedures and practices to enable the people’s broad, continuous, and intensive participation in day-to-day political activities.
人民政协是具有中国特色的制度安排，是社会主义协商民主的重要渠道和专门协商机构。人民政协工作要聚焦党和国家中心任务，围绕团结和民主两大主题，把协商民主贯穿政治协商、民主监督、参政议政全过程，完善协商议政内容和形式，着力增进共识、促进团结。加强人民政协民主监督，重点监督党和国家重大方针政策和重要决策部署的贯彻落实。增强人民政协界别的代表性，加强委员队伍建设。 
The CPPCC, as a distinctively Chinese political institution, is a major channel for socialist consultative democracy, and its committees are specialist consultative bodies. The CPPCC committees should focus on the Party and the country’s key tasks. With the themes of unity and democracy in mind, they should exercise consultative democracy throughout the whole process of political consultation, democratic oversight, and participation in the deliberation and administration of state affairs; and they should improve the content and forms of consultation and deliberation to build consensus and promote unity. They should strengthen democratic oversight, focusing on the implementation of the major principles, policies, decisions, and plans of the Party and the state. They should better represent the different social sectors and strengthen the competence of their members. 
（四）深化依法治国实践。 
Advancing law-based governance 
全面依法治国是国家治理的一场深刻革命，必须坚持厉行法治，推进科学立法、严格执法、公正司法、全民守法。成立中央全面依法治国领导小组，加强对法治中国建设的统一领导。加强宪法实施和监督，推进合宪性审查工作，维护宪法权威。推进科学立法、民主立法、依法立法，以良法促进发展、保障善治。建设法治政府，推进依法行政，严格规范公正文明执法。深化司法体制综合配套改革，全面落实司法责任制，努力让人民群众在每一个司法案件中感受到公平正义。
Advancing law-based governance in all fields is a profound revolution in China’s governance. We must promote the rule of law and work to ensure sound lawmaking, strict law enforcement, impartial administration of justice, and the observance of law by everyone. A central leading group for advancing law-based governance in all areas will be set up to exercise unified leadership over the initiative to build rule of law in China. We will strengthen oversight to ensure compliance with the Constitution, advance constitutionality review, and safeguard the authority of the Constitution. We will carry outlawmaking in a well-conceived and democratic way and in accordance with law, so that good laws are made to promote development and ensure good governance. We will build a rule oflaw government, promote law-based government administration, and see that law is enforced in a strict, procedure-based, impartial, and non-abusive way. We will carry out comprehensive and integrated reform of the judicial systemand enforce judicial accountability in all respects, so that the people can see in every judicial case that justice is served.
加大全民普法力度，建设社会主义法治文化，树立宪法法律至上、法律面前人人平等的法治理念。各级党组织和全体党员要带头尊法学法守法用法，任何组织和个人都不得有超越宪法法律的特权，绝不允许以言代法、以权压法、逐利违法、徇私枉法。 
We will redouble efforts to raise public awareness of the law, develop a socialist culture of rule of law, and increase public awareness of the principle underlying ruleoflaw that the Constitutionand the law are above everything else and that everyone is equal before the law. Every Party organization and every Party member must take the lead in respecting, learning about, observing, and applying the law. No organization or individual has the power to overstep the Constitution or the law; and no one in a positionof power isallowedin any way to override the law with his ownorders, place hisauthority above the law, violate the law for personal gain, or abuse the law. 
（五）深化机构和行政体制改革。 
Deepening reform of Party and government institutions and the system of government administration 
统筹考虑各类机构设置，科学配置党政部门及内设机构权力、明确职责。统筹使用各类编制资源，形成科学合理的管理体制，完善国家机构组织法。转变政府职能，深化简政放权，创新监管方式，增强政府公信力和执行力，建设人民满意的服务型政府。 
We will adopt a comprehensive approach to the setup of Party and government institutions, and ensure that powers are designated properly and functions and duties are defined clearly both for the institutions themselves and their internal bodies. We will use various types of staffing resources in a coordinated way, develop a sound system of administration, and improve the organic law for state institutions. The government needs to transform its functions, further streamline administration and delegate powers, develop new ways of regulation and supervision, and strengthen its credibility and administrative capacity, building itself into a service-oriented government able to satisfy the needs of the people. 
赋予省级及以下政府更多自主权。在省市县对职能相近的党政机关探索合并设立或合署办公。深化事业单位改革，强化公益属性，推进政事分开、事企分开、管办分离。 
More decision making power should be given to governments at and below the provincial level, and ways should be explored to merge Party and government bodies with similar functions at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels or for 
themto work together as one office while keeping separate identities. We will deepenthe reform of public institutions to see that they focus on serving public interests, relieve them of government functions, keep themaway frombusiness activities, and let themrun their own day-to-day operations while maintaining supervision over them. 
（六）巩固和发展爱国统一战线。 
Consolidating and developing the patriotic united front 
统一战线是党的事业取得胜利的重要法宝，必须长期坚持。要高举爱国主义、社会主义旗帜，牢牢把握大团结大联合的主题，坚持一致性和多样性统一，找到最大公约数，画出最大同心圆。坚持长期共存、互相监督、肝胆相照、荣辱与共，支持民主党派按照中国特色社会主义参政党要求更好履行职能。深化民族团结进步教育，铸牢中华民族共同体意识，加强各民族交往交流交融，促进各民族像石榴籽一样紧紧抱在一起，共同团结奋斗、共同繁荣发展。全面贯彻党的宗教工作基本方针，坚持我国宗教的中国化方向，积极引导宗教与社会主义社会相适应。加强党外知识分子工作，做好新的社会阶层人士工作，发挥他们在中国特色社会主义事业中的重要作用。构建亲清新型政商关系，促进非公有制经济健康发展和非公有制经济人士健康成长。广泛团结联系海外侨胞和归侨侨眷，共同致力于中华民族伟大复兴。 
The united front is an important way to ensure the success of the Party’s cause, and we must maintain commitment to it long term. We must uphold the banner of patriotism and socialism, strive to achievegreat unity andsolidarity,balancecommonality anddiversity, and expand common ground and the convergence of interests. In handling its relationshipswith other Chinese political parties,the Communist Party of China is guided by the principles of long-term coexistence, mutual oversight, sincerity, and sharing the rough times and the smooth, and it supports these parties in performing their duties in accordance with the requirements of the Chinese socialist system for their participation in governance.We will heighten publicawarenessof ethnic unity and progress, and create astrong sense of community for the Chinese nation. We will encourage more exchanges and interactions among different ethnic groups, helping them remain closely united like the seeds of a pomegranate that stick together, and work jointly for common prosperity and development. We will fully implement the Party’s basic policy on religious affairs, uphold the principle that religions in China must be Chinese in orientation and provide active guidance to religions so that they can adapt themselves to socialist society. We will encourage intellectuals who are not Party members and people belonging to new social groups to play the important roles they have in building socialismwith Chinese characteristics. We should form a new type of cordial and clean relationship between government and business, promote healthy growth of the non-public sector of the economy,and encourage those working in this sector to achieve success. We will maintain extensive contacts with overseas Chinese nationals, returned Chinese and their relatives and unite themso that they can join our endeavors to revitalize the Chinese nation. 
同志们！ 
Comrades, 
中国特色社会主义政治制度是中国共产党和中国人民的伟大创造。我们完全有信心、有能力把我国社会主义民主政治的优势和特点充分发挥出来，为人类政治文明进步作出充满中国智慧的贡献！ 
The political systemof socialismwith Chinese characteristics is agreat creation of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people. We have every confidence that we can give full play to the strengths and distinctive features of China’s socialist democracy, and make China’s contribution to the political advancement of mankind. 
七、坚定文化自信，推动社会主义文化繁荣兴盛 
Building Stronger Cultural Confidence and Helping Socialist Culture to Flourish 
文化是一个国家、一个民族的灵魂。文化兴国运兴，文化强民族强。没有高度的文化自信，没有文化的繁荣兴盛，就没有中华民族伟大复兴。要坚持中国特色社会主义文化发展道路，激发全民族文化创新创造活力，建设社会主义文化强国。 
Culture is a country and nation’s soul. Our country will thrive only if our culturethrives, and our nation will be strong only if our culture is strong. Without full confidence in our culture, without arich and prosperous culture, the Chinese nation will not be able to rejuvenate itself. We must develop a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics, inspire the cultural creativity of our whole nation, and develop a great socialist culture in China. 
中国特色社会主义文化，源自于中华民族五千多年文明历史所孕育的中华优秀传统文化，熔铸于党领导人民在革命、建设、改革中创造的革命文化和社会主义先进文化，植根于中国特色社会主义伟大实践。 
Socialist culture with Chinese characteristics is derived from China’s fine traditional culture, which was born of the Chinese civilization and nurtured over more than 5,000 years; it has grown out of the revolutionary and advanced socialist culture that developed over the course of the Chinese people’s revolution, construction, and reformunder the Party’sleadership; and it is rooted in the great practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
发展中国特色社会主义文化，就是以马克思主义为指导，坚守中华文化立场，立足当代中国现实，结合当今时代条件，发展面向现代化、面向世界、面向未来的，民族的科学的大众的社会主义文化，推动社会主义精神文明和物质文明协调发展。要坚持为人民服务、为社会主义服务，坚持百花齐放、百家争鸣，坚持创造性转化、创新性发展，不断铸就中华文化新辉煌。 
To develop socialist culture with Chinese characteristics meansto develop a socialist culture for our nation—a culture that is sound and people-oriented, that embraces modernization, the world, and the future, and that both promotes socialist material wellbeing and raises socialist cultural-ethical standards. In developing this culture, we must follow the guidance of Marxism, base our efforts on Chinese culture, and take into account the realities of contemporary China and the conditions of the present era. We should ensure that this culture serves the people and serves socialism. We should follow the principle of letting a hundred flowers bloomand a hundred schools of thought contend, and encourage creative transformation and development, so as to add new luster to Chinese culture. 
（一）牢牢掌握意识形态工作领导权。 
Holding firmly the leading position in ideological work 
意识形态决定文化前进方向和发展道路。必须推进马克思主义中国化时代化大众化，建设具有强大凝聚力和引领力的社会主义意识形态，使全体人民在理想信念、价值理念、道德观念上紧紧团结在一起。要加强理论武装，推动新时代中国特色社会主义思想深入人心。深化马克思主义理论研究和建设，加快构建中国特色哲学社会科学，加强中国特色新型智库建设。 
Ideology determines the direction a culture should take and thepath it should follow as it develops. We must continue to adapt Marxism to China’s conditions, keep it up-to-date, and enhance its popular appeal. We will develop socialist ideology that has the ability to unite and the power to inspire the people to embrace shared ideals, convictions, values, and moral standards. We will better arm ourselves with theory and increase the public appeal of the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. We will work harder to study and develop Marxist theory, work faster to develop philosophy and social sciences with Chinese characteristics, and develop new types of think tanks with distinctive Chinese features. 
高度重视传播手段建设和创新，提高新闻舆论传播力、引导力、影响力、公信力。加强互联网内容建设，建立网络综合治理体系，营造清朗的网络空间。落实意识形态工作责任制，加强阵地建设和管理，注意区分政治原则问题、思想认识问题、学术观点问题，旗帜鲜明反对和抵制各种错误观点。 
We will give priority to improving means of communication and to creating new ones, and will strengthen the penetration, guidance, influence, and credibility of the media. We will provide more and better online content and put in place a system for integrated internet management to ensure a clean cyberspace. We will implement the system of responsibility for ideological work, and further consolidate our positions and improve management in this field. We will distinguish between matters of political principle, issues of understanding and thinking, and academic viewpoints, but we must oppose and resist various erroneous views with a clear stand. 
（二）培育和践行社会主义核心价值观。 
Cultivating and observing core socialist values
社会主义核心价值观是当代中国精神的集中体现，凝结着全体人民共同的价值追求。要以培养担当民族复兴大任的时代新人为着眼点，强化教育引导、实践养成、制度保障，发挥社会主义核心价值观对国民教育、精神文明创建、精神文化产品创作生产传播的引领作用，把社会主义核心价值观融入社会发展各方面，转化为人们的情感认同和行为习惯。坚持全民行动、干部带头，从家庭做起，从娃娃抓起。深入挖掘中华优秀传统文化蕴含的思想观念、人文精神、道德规范，结合时代要求继承创新，让中华文化展现出永久魅力和时代风采。 
Core socialist values represent the contemporary Chinese spirit and are a crystallization of the values shared by all Chinese people. We will focus on fostering a new generation capable of shouldering the mission of national rejuvenation; we will offer them better guidance, expose them to practice, andprovide institutional guarantees. We will draw oncore socialist values to guide education, efforts to raise cultural-ethical standards, and the creation, production, and distribution of cultural and intellectual products, and see that all areas of social development are imbued with these values and that they become part of people’s thinking and behavior. To this end, we will encourage extensive public involvement, making our officials take the lead and starting with families and children. We will draw on China’s finetraditional culture, keepalive and develop its vision, concepts, values, and moral norms, and do so in a way that responds to the call of our era.With this wewill see thatChinese culture maintains its appeal and evolveswiththetimes. 
（三）加强思想道德建设。 
Raising intellectual and moral standards 
人民有信仰，国家有力量，民族有希望。要提高人民思想觉悟、道德水准、文明素养，提高全社会文明程度。广泛开展理想信念教育，深化中国特色社会主义和中国梦宣传教育，弘扬民族精神和时代精神，加强爱国主义、集体主义、社会主义教育，引导人们树立正确的历史观、民族观、国家观、文化观。深入实施公民道德建设工程，推进社会公德、职业道德、家庭美德、个人品德建设，激励人们向上向善、孝老爱亲，忠于祖国、忠于人民。 
When a people have ideals, their country will have strength, and their nation will have a bright future. We will help ourpeople raisetheir political awarenessand moral standards, foster appreciation of fine culture, and enhance social etiquette and civility. 
We will undertake extensive public awareness activities to help the people develop firm ideals and convictions, build their awareness of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the Chinese Dream, foster aChinese ethos and a readiness to respond to thecall of our times, strengthen the guiding role of patriotism, collectivism, and socialism, and see that the people develop an accurate understanding of history, ethnicity, country, and culture. We will launch a civic morality campaign to raise public ethical standards, and enhance work ethics, familyvirtues, and personal integrity. Wewill encourage our people to strive for excellence andto develop stronger virtues, respect the elderly, love families, and be loyal to the country and the people.
加强和改进思想政治工作，深化群众性精神文明创建活动。弘扬科学精神，普及科学知识，开展移风易俗、弘扬时代新风行动，抵制腐朽落后文化侵蚀。推进诚信建设和志愿服务制度化，强化社会责任意识、规则意识、奉献意识。 
We will improve and strengthen our ideological and politicalwork, and launch initiatives to raise the public’s cultural-ethical standards. We will promote the spirit of science and make scientific knowledge widely attainable; we will work to see the back of outdated social mores and to promote good and up-to-date practices and trends; and we will resist the corrosive influence of backward and decadent culture. We will promote credibility building, institutionalize volunteer services, and heighten people’s sense of social responsibility, awareness of rules, and sense of dedication. 
（四）繁荣发展社会主义文艺。 
Seeing socialist literature and art thrive 
社会主义文艺是人民的文艺，必须坚持以人民为中心的创作导向，在深入生活、扎根人民中进行无愧于时代的文艺创造。要繁荣文艺创作，坚持思想精深、艺术精湛、制作精良相统一，加强现实题材创作，不断推出讴歌党、讴歌祖国、讴歌人民、讴歌英雄的精品力作。发扬学术民主、艺术民主，提升文艺原创力，推动文艺创新。倡导讲品位、讲格调、讲责任，抵制低俗、庸俗、媚俗。加强文艺队伍建设，造就一大批德艺双馨名家大师，培育一大批高水平创作人才。

A military is built to fight. Our military must regard combat capability as the criterion to meet in all its work and focus on how to win when it is called on. We will take solid steps to ensure military preparedness for all strategic directions, and make progress incombat readiness in bothtraditional and new security fields. We will developnew combat forces and support forces, conduct military training under combat conditions, strengthen the application of military strength, speed up development of intelligent military,and improvecombat capabilities for jointoperations based on network information system and the ability to fight under multi-dimensional conditions. This will enable us to effectively shape our military posture, manage crises, and deter and win wars.

同志们！ 
Comrades,

Our military is the people’s military, and our national defense is the responsibility of every one of us. We must raise public awareness about the importance of national defense and strengthen unity between thegovernment and the military andbetween the people and the military. Let us work together to create a mighty force for realizing the Chinese Dreamand the dreamof building a powerful military. 
十一、坚持“一国两制”，推进祖国统一 
Upholding “One Country, Two Systems” and Moving toward National Reunification 
香港、澳门回归祖国以来， “一国两制”实践取得举世公认的成功。事实证明， “一国两制”是解决历史遗留的香港、澳门问题的最佳方案，也是香港、澳门回归后保持长期繁荣稳定的最佳制度。 
Since Hong Kong and Macao’s return to the motherland, the practice of “one country, two systems,/ in both regions has been aresounding success. The policy of “one country, two systems”has proved to be the best solution to the questions ofHong Kong and Macao, left by history, and the best institutional guarantee for the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao after their return.
保持香港、澳门长期繁荣稳定，必须全面准确贯彻 “一国两制”、“港人治港”、“澳人治澳”、高度自治的方针，严格依照宪法和基本法办事，完善与基本法实施相关的制度和机制。要支持特别行政区政府和行政长官依法施政、积极作为，团结带领香港、澳门各界人士齐心协力谋发展、促和谐，保障和改善民生，有序推进民主，维护社会稳定，履行维护国家主权、安全、发展利益的宪制责任。 
To maintain long-termprosperity and stability in Hong Kong andMacao, it is imperative to fully and faithfully implement the policies of “‘one country, two systems,” “the people of Hong Kong governing Hong Kong, “the people of Macao governing Macao,” and a high degree of autonomy for both regions. It is imperative too, to act in strict compliance with China’s Constitution and the basic laws of the two special administrative regions, and to improve the systems and mechanisms for enforcing the basic laws. We will continue to support the governments and chief executives of both regions in pursuing the following endeavors: exercising law-based governance, uniting and leading the people of all sectors in an active and concerted effort to promote development and harmony, ensuring and improving people’s wellbeing, taking well-ordered steps to advance democracy, maintaining law and order, and fulfilling the constitutional responsibility ofsafeguarding China’s sovereignty, security, and development interests. 
香港、澳门发展同内地发展紧密相连。要支持香港、澳门融入国家发展大局，以粤港澳大湾区建设、粤港澳合作、泛珠三角区域合作等为重点，全面推进内地同香港、澳门互利合作，制定完善便利香港、澳门居民在内地发展的政策措施。 
The development of Hong Kong and Macao is closely tied up with that of the mainland. We will continue to support Hong Kong and Macao in integrating their own development into the overall development of the country. We will give priorityto the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, cooperation between Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao, and regional cooperation in the pan-Pearl River Delta, thus fully advancing mutually beneficial cooperation between the mainland and the two regions. We will formulate and improve policies and measures to make it more convenient for people from Hong Kong and Macao to develop careers on the mainland. 
我们坚持爱国者为主体的“港人治港”、“澳人治澳”，发展壮大爱国爱港爱澳力量，增强香港、澳门同胞的国家意识和爱国精神，让香港、澳门同胞同祖国人民共担民族复兴的历史责任、共享祖国繁荣富强的伟大荣光。解决台湾问题、实现祖国完全统一，是全体中华儿女共同愿望，是中华民族根本利益所在。必须继续坚持“和平统一、一国两制”方针，推动两岸关系和平发展，推进祖国和平统一进程。 
We will remain committed to the policy for the Hong Kong peopleto govern Hong Kong and the Macao people to govern Macao, with patriots playing the principal role. We will develop and strengthen the ranks of patriots who love both our country and their regions, and foster greater patriotism and a stronger sense of national identity among the people in Hong Kong and Macao. With this, our compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao will share both the historic responsibility of national rejuvenation and the pride of astrong and prosperous China, Resolving the Taiwan question to realize China’s complete reunification is the shared aspiration of all Chinese people, and is in the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation. We must uphold the principles of “peaceful reunification” and “one country, two systems,” work for the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, and advance the process toward the peaceful reunification of China. 
一个中国原则是两岸关系的政治基础。体现一个中国原则的 “九二共识”明确界定了两岸关系的根本性质，是确保两岸关系和平发展的关键。承认 “九二共识”的历史事实，认同两岸同属一个中国，两岸双方就能开展对话，协商解决两岸同胞关心的问题，台湾任何政党和团体同大陆交往也不会存在障碍。 
The one-China principle is the political foundation of cross-Straits relations. The 1992 Consensus embodies the one-China principle and defines the fundamentalnature of cross-Straits relations; it thus holds the key to the peaceful development of relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits. Recognize the historical fact of the 1992 Consensus and that the two sides both belong to one China, and then our two sides can conduct dialogue to address through discussion the concerns of the people of both sides, and no political party or group in Taiwan will have any difficulty conducting exchanges with the mainland. 
两岸同胞是命运与共的骨肉兄弟，是血浓于水的一家人。我们秉持 “两岸一家亲”理念，尊重台湾现有的社会制度和台湾同胞生活方式，愿意率先同台湾同胞分享大陆发展的机遇。我们将扩大两岸经济文化交流合作，实现互利互惠，逐步为台湾同胞在大陆学习、创业、就业、生活提供与大陆同胞同等的待遇，增进台湾同胞福祉。我们将推动两岸同胞共同弘扬中华文化，促进心灵契合。 
Blood is thicker than water. People on both sides of the Taiwan Straits are brothers and sisters; we share the bond of kinship. Guided by the conviction that we are all of the same family, we respect the current social system and way of life in Taiwan and are ready to share the development opportunities on the mainland with our Taiwan compatriots first. We will expand cross-Straits economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation for mutual benefits. We will ensure that over time, people fromTaiwan will enjoy the sametreatment as local people when they pursue their studies, start businesses, seek jobs, or live on the mainland, thus improving the wellbeing of Taiwan compatriots. We will encourage people from both sides to work together to promote Chinese culture and forge closer bonds between them. 
我们坚决维护国家主权和领土完整，绝不容忍国家分裂的历史悲剧重演。一切分裂祖国的活动都必将遭到全体中国人坚决反对。我们有坚定的意志、充分的信心、足够的能力挫败任何形式的“台独”分裂图谋。我们绝不允许任何人、任何组织、任何政党、在任何时候、以任何形式、把任何一块中国领土从中国分裂出去！ 
We stand firm in safeguarding China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and will never allow the historical tragedy of national division to repeat itself. Any separatist activity is certain to meet with the resolute opposition of the Chinese people. We have the resolve, the confidence, and the ability to defeat separatist attempts for “Taiwan independence” in any form. We will never allow anyone, any organization, or any political party, at any time or in any form, to separate any part of Chinese territory from China. 
同志们！ 
Comrades, 
实现中华民族伟大复兴，是全体中国人共同的梦想。我们坚信，只要包括港澳台同胞在内的全体中华儿女顺应历史大势、共担民族大义，把民族命运牢牢掌握在自己手中，就一定能够共创中华民族伟大复兴的美好未来！ 
Realizing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is a dream shared by all of us as Chinese. We remain firmin our conviction that, as long as all the sons anddaughters of the Chinese nation, including our compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, follow the tide of history, work together for the greater national interests, and keep our nation’s destiny firmly in our own hands, we will, without doubt, be able to achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. 
十二、坚持和平发展道路，推动构建人类命运共同体 
Following a Path of Peaceful Development and Working to Build a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind 
中国共产党是为中国人民谋幸福的政党，也是为人类进步事业而奋斗的政党。中国共产党始终把为人类作出新的更大的贡献作为自己的使命。 
The Communist Party of China strives for both the wellbeing of the Chinese people and human progress. To make new and greater contributions for mankind is our Party’s abiding mission. 
中国将高举和平、发展、合作、共赢的旗帜，恪守维护世界和平、促进共同发展的外交政策宗旨，坚定不移在和平共处五项原则基础上发展同各国的友好合作，推动建设相互尊重、公平正义、合作共赢的新型国际关系。 
China will continue to hold high the banner of peace, development, cooperation, and mutual benefit and uphold its fundamental foreign policy goal of preserving world peace and promoting common development. China remains firm in its commitment to strengthening friendship and cooperation with other countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and to forging a new form of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice, and win-win cooperation. 
世界正处于大发展大变革大调整时期，和平与发展仍然是时代主题。世界多极化、经济全球化、社会信息化、文化多样化深入发展，全球治理体系和国际秩序变革加速推进，各国相互联系和依存日益加深，国际力量对比更趋平衡，和平发展大势不可逆转。 
The world is undergoing major developments, transformation, and adjustment, but peace and development remain the call of our day. The trends of global multi-polarity, economic globalization, IT application, and cultural diversity are surging forward; changes in the global governance system and the international order are speeding up; countries are becoming increasingly interconnected and interdependent; relative international forces are becoming morebalanced; and peace and development remain irreversible trends. 
同时，世界面临的不稳定性不确定性突出，世界经济增长动能不足，贫富分化日益严重，地区热点问题此起彼伏，恐怖主义、网络安全、重大传染性疾病、气候变化等非传统安全威胁持续蔓延，人类面临许多共同挑战。 
And yet, as a world we face growing uncertainties and destabilizing factors. Global economic growth lacks energy; the gap between rich and poor continues to widen; hotspot issues arise often in some regions; and unconventional security threats like terrorism, cyber-insecurity, major infectious diseases, and climate change continue to spread.As human beings we have many common challenges to face.
我们生活的世界充满希望，也充满挑战。我们不能因现实复杂而放弃梦想，不能因理想遥远而放弃追求。没有哪个国家能够独自应对人类面临的各种挑战，也没有哪个国家能够退回到自我封闭的孤岛。 
Our world is full of both hope and challenges. We should not give up on our dreams because the reality around us is too complicated; we should not stop pursuing our ideals becausethey seem out of our reach. No country can alone address the many challenges facing mankind; no country can afford to retreat into self-isolation. 
我们呼吁，各国人民同心协力，构建人类命运共同体，建设持久和平、普遍安全、共同繁荣、开放包容、清洁美丽的世界。要相互尊重、平等协商，坚决摒弃冷战思维和强权政治，走对话而不对抗、结伴而不结盟的国与国交往新路。要坚持以对话解决争端、以协商化解分歧，统筹应对传统和非传统安全威胁，反对一切形式的恐怖主义。要同舟共济，促进贸易和投资自由化便利化，推动经济全球化朝着更加开放、包容、普惠、平衡、共赢的方向发展。要尊重世界文明多样性，以文明交流超越文明隔阂、文明互鉴超越文明冲突、文明共存超越文明优越。要坚持环境友好，合作应对气候变化，保护好人类赖以生存的地球家园。 
We call on the people of all countries to work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind, to build an open, inclusive, clean, and beautiful world that enjoys lastingpeace, universal security, and common prosperity. We should respect each other, discuss issues as equals, resolutely reject the Cold War mentality and power politics, and take anew approach to developing state-to-state relations with communication, not confrontation and partnership, not alliance. We should commit to settling disputes through dialogue and resolving differences through discussion, coordinate responses to traditional and non-traditional threats, andoppose terrorismin all its forms. We should stick together through thick and thin, promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and make econonuc globalization more open, inclusive, and balanced so that its benefits are shared by all. We should respect the diversity of civilizations. In handling relations among civilizations, let us replace estrangement with exchange, clashes with mutual learning, and superiority with coexistence. We should be good friends to the environment, cooperate to tackle climate change, and protect our planet for the sake of human survival. 
中国坚定奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，尊重各国人民自主选择发展道路的权利，维护国际公平正义，反对把自己的意志强加于人，反对干涉别国内政，反对以强凌弱。 
China remains firm in pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace. We respect the right of the people of all countries to choose their own development path. Weendeavor to uphold international fairness and justice, and oppose acts that impose one’s will onothers or interfere in the internal affairs of others as well as the practice of the strong bullying the weak. 
中国决不会以牺牲别国利益为代价来发展自己，也决不放弃自己的正当权益，任何人不要幻想让中国吞下损害自身利益的苦果。中国奉行防御性的国防政策。中国发展不对任何国家构成威胁。中国无论发展到什么程度，永远不称霸，永远不搞扩张。 
China will never pursue development at the expense of others’ interests, but nor will China ever give up its legitimate rights and interests. No one should expect China to swallow anything that undermines its interests. China pursues a national defense policy that is in nature defensive. China’s development does not pose a threat to any other country. No matter what stage of development it reaches, China will never seek hegemony or engage in expansion.
中国积极发展全球伙伴关系，扩大同各国的利益交汇点，推进大国协调和合作，构建总体稳定、均衡发展的大国关系框架，按照亲诚惠容理念和与邻为善、以邻为伴周边外交方针深化同周边国家关系，秉持正确义利观和真实亲诚理念加强同发展中国家团结合作。加强同各国政党和政治组织的交流合作，推进人大、政协、军队、地方、人民团体等的对外交往。中国坚持对外开放的基本国策，坚持打开国门搞建设，积极促进 “一带一路”国际合作，努力实现政策沟通、设施联通、贸易畅通、资金融通、民心相通，打造国际合作新平台，增添共同发展新动力。加大对发展中国家特别是最不发达国家援助力度，促进缩小南北发展差距。中国支持多边贸易体制，促进自由贸易区建设，推动建设开放型世界经济。 
China has actively developed global partnerships and expanded the convergence of interests with other countries. China will promote coordination and cooperation with other major countries and work to build aframework for major country relations featuring overall stability and balanced development. 
China will deepen relations with its neighbors in accordance with the principle of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit, and inclusiveness and the policy of forging friendship and partnership with its neighbors. China will, guided by the principle of upholding justice while pursuing shared interests and the principle of sincerity, honesty, affinity, and good faith, work to strengthen solidarity and cooperation with other developing countries. We will strengthen exchanges and cooperation with the political parties and organizations of other countries, and encourage people’s congresses, CPPCC committees, the military, local governments, and people’s organizations to engage in exchanges with other countries. 
China adheres to the fundamental national policy of opening up and pursues development with its doors open wide. China will actively promote international cooperation through the Belt and Road Initiative. In doing so, wehopeto achieve policy, infrastructure, trade, financial, and people-to-people connectivity and thus build anewplatformfor international cooperation to create new drivers of shared development. China will increase assistance to other developing countries, especially the least developed countries, and do its part to reduce the North-South development gap. China will support multilateral trade regimes and work to facilitate the establishment of free trade areas and build an open world economy. 
中国秉持共商共建共享的全球治理观，倡导国际关系民主化，坚持国家不分大小、强弱、贫富一律平等，支持联合国发挥积极作用，支持扩大发展中国家在国际事务中的代表性和发言权。中国将继续发挥负责任大国作用，积极参与全球治理体系改革和建设，不断贡献中国智慧和力量。 
China follows the principle of achieving shared growth through discussion and collaboration in engaging in global governance. China stands for democracy in international relations and the equality of all countries, big or small,strong or weak, rich or poor. China supports the United Nations in playing an active role in international affairs, and supports the efforts of other developing countries to increase their representation and strengthen their voice in international affairs. China will continue to play its part as a major and responsible country, take an active part in reforming and developing the global governance system, and keep contributing Chinese wisdom and strength to global governance. 
同志们！ 
Comrades, 
世界命运握在各国人民手中，人类前途系于各国人民的抉择。中国人民愿同各国人民一道，推动人类命运共同体建设，共同创造人类的美好未来！
The future of the world rests in the hands of the people of all countries; the future of mankind hinges on the choices they make. We, the Chinese, are ready to work with the people of all other countries to build a community with a shared future for mankind and create a bright tomorrow for all of us. 
十三、坚定不移全面从严治党，不断提高党的执政能力和领导水平 
Exercising Strict Governance over the Party and Improving the Party’s Ability to Govern and Lead 
中国特色社会主义进入新时代，我们党一定要有新气象新作为。打铁必须自身硬。党要团结带领人民进行伟大斗争、推进伟大事业、实现伟大梦想，必须毫不动摇坚持和完善党的领导，毫不动摇把党建设得更加坚强有力。 
As socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, our Party must get a new look and make new accomplishments. As the saying goes, it takes a good blacksmith to make good steel. For the Party to unite the people and lead them in carrying out our great struggle, advancing our great cause, and realizing our great dream, we must unwaveringly uphold and improve Party leadership and make the Party still stronger. 
全面从严治党永远在路上。一个政党，一个政权，其前途命运取决于人心向背。人民群众反对什么、痛恨什么，我们就要坚决防范和纠正什么。全党要清醒认识到，我们党面临的执政环境是复杂的，影响党的先进性、弱化党的纯洁性的因素也是复杂的，党内存在的思想不纯、组织不纯、作风不纯等突出问题尚未得到根本解决。要深刻认识党面临的执政考验、改革开放考验、市场经济考验、外部环境考验的长期性和复杂性，深刻认识党面临的精神懈怠危险、能力不足危险、脱离群众危险、消极腐败危险的尖锐性和严峻性，坚持问题导向，保持战略定力，推动全面从严治党向纵深发展。 
Ensuring Party self-governance isexercised fully and strictly is ajourney to which there’s no end. The future ofa political party or a government is determined by whether it enjoys public support. We must guard against and correct with resolve the practices the people oppose and resent. The whole Party must be soberly aware that the governance environment our Party faces is complex, and that so too are the factors undermining the Party’s advanced nature and purity; prominent problems of impurity in thinking, organization, and conduct in the Party have not been solved root and branch. 
We must fully recognize the long-term and complex nature of the tests confronting the Party as they relate to governance, reform and opening up, the market economy, and the external environment. We must also fully recognize the intensity and severity ofthe dangers of a lack of drive, incompetence, disengagement from the people, inaction, and corruption. So we must fcxrus on solving problems, maintain strategic resolve, and ensure strict Party self-governance.
新时代党的建设总要求是：坚持和加强党的全面领导，坚持党要管党、全面从严治党，以加强党的长期执政能力建设、先进性和纯洁性建设为主线，以党的政治建设为统领，以坚定理想信念宗旨为根基，以调动全党积极性、主动性、创造性为着力点，全面推进党的政治建设、思想建设、组织建设、作风建设、纪律建设，把制度建设贯穿其中，深入推进反腐败斗争，不断提高党的建设质量，把党建设成为始终走在时代前列、人民衷心拥护、勇于自我革命、经得起各种风浪考验、朝气蓬勃的马克思主义执政党。 
The general requirements for Party building for the new era are: Uphold and strengthen overall Party leadership and ensure that the Party exercises effective self-supervision and practices strict self-governance in every respect; Take strengthening the Party’s long-term governance capacity and its advanced nature and purity as the main thrust; take enhancing the Party’s political building as the overarching principle; take holding dear the Party’s ideals, convictions, and purpose as the underpinning; and take harnessing the whole Party’s enthusiasm,initiative, and creativity as the focus of efforts; Make all-round efforts to see the Party’s political building enhanced, its theory strengthened, its organizations consolidated, its conduct improved, and its discipline enforced, with institution building incorporated into every aspect of Party building; Step up efforts to combat corruption and continue to improve the efficacy of Party building; Build the Party into a vibrant Marxist governing party that is always at the forefront of the times, enjoys the wholehearted support of the people, has the courage to reform itself, and is able towithstand all tests.
（一）把党的政治建设摆在首位。旗帜鲜明讲政治是我们党作为马克思主义政党的根本要求。党的政治建设是党的根本性建设，决定党的建设方向和效果。保证全党服从中央，坚持党中央权威和集中统一领导，是党的政治建设的首要任务。全党要坚定执行党的政治路线，严格遵守政治纪律和政治规矩，在政治立场、政治方向、政治原则、政治道路上同党中央保持高度一致。要尊崇党章，严格执行新形势下党内政治生活若干准则，增强党内政治生活的政治性、时代性、原则性、战斗性，自觉抵制商品交换原则对党内生活的侵蚀，营造风清气正的良好政治生态。完善和落实民主集中制的各项制度，坚持民主基础上的集中和集中指导下的民主相结合，既充分发扬民主，又善于集中统一。弘扬忠诚老实、公道正派、实事求是、清正廉洁等价值观，坚决防止和反对个人主义、分散主义、自由主义、本位主义、好人主义，坚决防止和反对宗派主义、圈子文化、码头文化，坚决反对搞两面派、做两面人。全党同志特别是高级干部要加强党性锻炼，不断提高政治觉悟和政治能力，把对党忠诚、为党分忧、为党尽职、为民造福作为根本政治担当，永葆共产党人政治本色。 
The primary task of political Party building is to ensure that the whole Party obeys the Central Committee and upholds its authority and centralized, unified leadership. All Party members must closely follow the Party’s political line, strictly observe its political discipline and rules, and closely align themselves with theCentral Committee interms ofpolitical stance, direction, principle, and path. Every member ofthe Party must hold the Party Constitution in great reverence, act in strict accordance with the code of conduct for intraparty political life under new circumstances, and make intraparty activities more politically oriented, up-to-date, principled, and effective. We must guard against the rules of business dealings eroding intraparty conduct, and foster a healthy political atmosphere of integritywithin theParty. We must improve and implement the systems of democratic centralism, and practice both democracy-based centralism and centralism-guided democracy. This means we should both give full play to democracy and practice centralism on this basis. We must foster values like loyalty, honesty, impartiality, a realistic approach, and integrity; guard against and oppose self-centered behavior, decentralism,behavior in disregard ofthe rules, a silo mentality, unprincipled nice-guyism, and sectarianism, factionalism, and patronage. We must resolutely oppose double-dealing and duplicity. All Party members, especially high-ranking officials, must strengthen their Party consciousness, political awareness, and political ability. Wemust regard it as our fundamental political responsibility to be loyal to the Party, share the Party’s concerns, fulfill our obligations to the Party, and work for the people’s wellbeing, and forever preserve the political character of Communists. 
（二）用新时代中国特色社会主义思想武装全党。 
Arming the whole Party with the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era 
思想建设是党的基础性建设。革命理想高于天。共产主义远大理想和中国特色社会主义共同理想，是中国共产党人的精神支柱和政治灵魂，也是保持党的团结统一的思想基础。要把坚定理想信念作为党的思想建设的首要任务，教育引导全党牢记党的宗旨，挺起共产党人的精神脊梁，解决好世界观、人生观、价值观这个 “总开关”问题，自觉做共产主义远大理想和中国特色社会主义共同理想的坚定信仰者和忠实实践者。弘扬马克思主义学风，推进 “两学一做”学习教育常态化制度化，以县处级以上领导干部为重点，在全党开展 “不忘初心、牢记使命 ”主题教育，用党的创新理论武装头脑，推动全党更加自觉地为实现新时代党的历史使命不懈奋斗。
Theory is fundamental to Party building. Our revolutionary ideals soar beyond the skies. The noble ideal of Communism and the shared ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics are our source of strength and political soul as Chinese Communists; they also formthe theoretical foundation of Party solidarity and Our top priority in building the Party through theory is to stay true to our ideals and convictions. We should make all Party members keep firmly in mind the Party’s purpose, have unwavering convictions as Communists, resolve the fundamental issue of the worldview, outlook on life, and values we should embrace, and maintain deep belief in and faithfully practice Communism and socialism with Chinese characteristics. We will foster a Marxist style of learning, and make it regular practice and an institutionalized requirement for all Party members to gain a good command of the Party Constitution, Party regulations, and related major policy addresses and to meet Party standards. We will launch a campaign on the theme ofstaying true to our founding mission/, to enable all Party members, especially officials at and above the county and director level, to arm themselves with the Party’s new theories and become more purposeful in working tirelessly to accomplish the Party’s historic mission in the new era. 
（三）建设高素质专业化干部队伍。 
Training a contingent of competent and professional officials 
党的干部是党和国家事业的中坚力量。要坚持党管干部原则，坚持德才兼备、以德为先，坚持五湖四海、任人唯贤，坚持事业为上、公道正派，把好干部标准落到实处。坚持正确选人用人导向，匡正选人用人风气，突出政治标准，提拔重用牢固树立“四个意识”和“四个自信”、坚决维护党中央权威、全面贯彻执行党的理论和路线方针政策、忠诚干净担当的干部，选优配强各级领导班子。注重培养专业能力、专业精神，增强干部队伍适应新时代中国特色社会主义发展要求的能力。大力发现储备年轻干部，注重在基层一线和困难艰苦的地方培养锻炼年轻干部，源源不断选拔使用经过实践考验的优秀年轻干部。统筹做好培养选拔女干部、少数民族干部和党外干部工作。认真做好离退休干部工作。坚持严管和厚爱结合、激励和约束并重，完善干部考核评价机制，建立激励机制和容错纠错机制，旗帜鲜明为那些敢于担当、踏实做事、不谋私利的干部撑腰鼓劲。各级党组织要关心爱护基层干部，主动为他们排忧解难。 
Party officials are a central pillar of strength for the cause of our Party and country. We must adhere to the principle of the Party supervising officials; select officials on the basis of both integrity and ability, with priority given to integrity, and on the basis of merit regardless of background; and ensure that those who are dedicated, impartial, and upright should be appointed. We must implement in earnest the criteria for evaluating good officials. In selecting and appointing officials, we must adopt the right approach, with emphasis on political performance. We will promote and put in important positions those Party officials who do well according to the following criteria: they maintain political integrity, think in terms of the big picture, follow the leadership core, and keep in alignment with the central Partyleadership; they have full confidence in the path,theory, system, and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics;they uphold the authority of the Central Committee andfaithfullyfollow the Party’s theories, lines, principles,and policies;and theyare loyal to the Party, have moral integrity, and demonstrate a keen sense of responsibility. We will strengthen leadership teams at all levels by appointing competent officials. We will take seriously the development of specialized expertise and professionalism, and enhance Party officials’ ability to meet the requirements of developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. Wewill work harder to identify promising young officials and get them well prepared for future jobs. We will focus on their practical training in local communities, in work on the frontline, and in areas where conditions are harsh, and work to produce a constant stream of outstanding young officials who have passed the test of practice. We will 
ensure coordinated training and selection of female officials, officials from ethnic minorities, and non-Party officials. We will ensure that retired officials are well taken care of. We will be both strict and caring, and place equal emphasis on providing incentives and imposing constraints. We will improve the performance assessment and evaluation system for officials, institute incentive mechanisms and mechanisms to allow for and address errors, and take a clear stand in supporting officials who are willing to assume responsibility, who take a down-to-earth approach in their work, and who do not seek personal gain. Party organizations at every level should care about officials working at the primary level, and help solve the problems and difficulties they encounter.
人才是实现民族振兴、赢得国际竞争主动的战略资源。要坚持党管人才原则，聚天下英才而用之，加快建设人才强国。实行更加积极、更加开放、更加有效的人才政策，以识才的慧眼、爱才的诚意、用才的胆识、容才的雅量、聚才的良方，把党内和党外、国内和国外各方面优秀人才集聚到党和人民的伟大奋斗中来，鼓励引导人才向边远贫困地区、边疆民族地区、革命老区和基层一线流动，努力形成人人渴望成才、人人努力成才、人人皆可成才、人人尽展其才的良好局面，让各类人才的创造活力竞相迸发、聪明才智充分涌流。 
People with talent are a strategic resource for China as it endeavors to achieve national rejuvenation and stay ahead in international competition. We must follow the principle of the Party exercising leadership over personnel, assemble the best minds across the land and draw fully on their expertise, and step up efforts to make China a talent-strong country. We will pursue a more proactive, open, and effective policy on training competent professionals.We should value people with talent, be good at identifying talent, have the foresight to employ them, be earnest to keep them, and welcome theminto our ranks. Thiswill better enable us to attract bright people fromboth within and outside the Party and both in China and abroad to join us in pursuing the great endeavor of the Party and the people. We will encourage and guide people with talent to work in remote poor areas, border areas with mainly ethnic minority populations, and old revolutionary base areas, as well as in communities and on the frontlines. We will workto foster a positive environment in which everyone wants, strives, and is able to excel themselves, and can do full justice to their talents. With this, we aimto see that in every field the creativity of talent is given great expression and their ingenuity and expertise flow freely. 
（四）加强基层组织建设。 
Strengthening primary-level Party organizations 
党的基层组织是确保党的路线方针政策和决策部署贯彻落实的基础。要以提升组织力为重点，突出政治功能，把企业、农村、机关、学校、科研院所、街道社区、社会组织等基层党组织建设成为宣传党的主张、贯彻党的决定、领导基层治理、团结动员群众、推动改革发展的坚强战斗堡垒。党支部要担负好直接教育党员、管理党员、监督党员和组织群众、宣传群众、凝聚群众、服务群众的职责，引导广大党员发挥先锋模范作用。坚持 “三会一课”制度，推进党的基层组织设置和活动方式创新，加强基层党组织带头人队伍建设，扩大基层党组织覆盖面，着力解决一些基层党组织弱化、虚化、边缘化问题。扩大党内基层民主，推进党务公开，畅通党员参与党内事务、监督党的组织和干部、向上级党组织提出意见和建议的渠道。注重从产业工人、青年农民、高知识群体中和在非公有制经济组织、社会组织中发展党员。加强党内激励关怀帮扶。增强党员教育管理针对性和有效性，稳妥有序开展不合格党员组织处置工作。 
Primary-level Party organizations do the groundwork to ensure the Party’s lines, principles, policies, decisions, and plans are implemented. We will work to ensure that primary-level Party organizations in enterprises, villages, Party and government departments, schools, research institutes, sub-districts, communities, and social organizations play a key role in communicating the Party’s propositions, carrying out the Party’s decisions, overseeing community-level social governance, uniting and mobilizing the people, and promoting reformand development. In doingso, we will focus on improving the organizational capability of primary-level Party organizations and give priority to enhancing their political functions. Party branches should fulfill their responsibilities for directly guiding, managing, and overseeing their members and for organizing, communicating with, uniting, and serving the people. They should encourage their members to play an exemplary role. We must practice the system of holding Party branch general meetings, meetings of Party branch committees, Party group meetings, and Partylectures. We will develop newways for setting upprimary-level Party organizations and for them to carry out their activities, strengthen the training of their heads, and expand their reach. We must work harder to address the problems that some primary-level Party organizations are weak, ineffective, and marginalized. We will expand intraparty democracy at the primary level, make Party affairs more transparent, and ensure channels are open for Party members to participate in Party affairs, oversee Party organizations and officials, and submit opinions and suggestions to the Party organization at the next level up. We will do more to recruit new Party members fromamong industrial workers, young people working in agriculture, well-educatedgroups, and people working in non-public economic entities and social organizations. We will give more incentives, solicitude, and assistance to Party members. We will make our guidance and management of Party members better targeted and more effective, and handle Party members that don’t meet the mark in a prudent and orderly way. 
（五）持之以恒正风肃纪。 
Working ceaselessly to improve Party conduct and enforce Party discipline 
我们党来自人民、植根人民、服务人民，一旦脱离群众，就会失去生命力。加强作风建设，必须紧紧围绕保持党同人民群众的血肉联系，增强群众观念和群众感情，不断厚植党执政的群众基础。凡是群众反映强烈的问题都要严肃认真对待，凡是损害群众利益的行为都要坚决纠正。坚持以上率下，巩固拓展落实中央八项规定精神成果，继续整治 “四风”问题，坚决反对特权思想和特权现象。重点强化政治纪律和组织纪律，带动廉洁纪律、群众纪律、工作纪律、生活纪律严起来。坚持开展批评和自我批评，坚持惩前毖后、治病救人，运用监督执纪 “四种形态”，抓早抓小、防微杜渐。赋予有干部管理权限的党组相应纪律处分权限，强化监督执纪问责。加强纪律教育，强化纪律执行，让党员、干部知敬畏、存戒惧、守底线，习惯在受监督和约束的环境中工作生活。 
Our Party comes fromthe people, has its roots among the people, and is dedicated to serving the people. Once the Party becomes disengaged from the people, it will lose itsvitality. Inimproving Party conduct, we must focus on maintaining the Party’s close bond with the people, keep them firmly in mind, develop a closer affinity with them, and keep working to foster stronger public support for the Party’s governance. We must earnestly address all issues the people are strongly concerned about, and resolutely correct any behavior that undermines the people’s interests. Our Party officials should lead by example in consolidating and building on the advances made in implementing the central Party leadership’s eight-point decision on improving Party and government conduct. We should continue to address the practice of formalities for formalities’ sake, bureaucratism, hedonism, and extravagance, and oppose mindsets and actsof privilege seeking. Wewill focus on strengthening the enforcement of political and organizational discipline, and use this to prompt stricter observance of discipline on upholding integrity, on interacting with the people, and regarding work and life. We will continue to carry out criticismand self-criticisminkeeping with the principle of learning from mistakes to prevent recurrence and treating the illness to save the patient. We will conduct four forms of oversight over discipline compliance,1 identify problems early and correct them while they are nascent. Party organizations with the power to supervise officials will be given corresponding power to take disciplinary action as called for, and accountability for overseeing discipline compliance will be tightened up on. We will raise Party members’ awareness of discipline and strengthen discipline enforcement, and demand that Party members and officials hold discipline in awe and respect, do not cross the line, and become used to working and living under oversight and constraints. 
（六）夺取反腐败斗争压倒性胜利。 
Securing a sweeping victory in the fight against corruption 
人民群众最痛恨腐败现象，腐败是我们党面临的最大威胁。只有以反腐败永远在路上的坚韧和执着，深化标本兼治，保证干部清正、政府清廉、政治清明，才能跳出历史周期率，确保党和国家长治久安。当前，反腐败斗争形势依然严峻复杂，巩固压倒性态势、夺取压倒性胜利的决心必须坚如磐石。要坚持无禁区、全覆盖、零容忍，坚持重遏制、强高压、长震慑，坚持受贿行贿一起查，坚决防止党内形成利益集团。在市县党委建立巡察制度，加大整治群众身边腐败问题力度。不管腐败分子逃到哪里，都要缉拿归案、绳之以法。推进反腐败国家立法，建设覆盖纪检监察系统的检举举报平台。强化不敢腐的震慑，扎牢不能腐的笼子，增强不想腐的自觉，通过不懈努力换来海晏河清、朗朗乾坤。 
The people resent corruption most; and corruption is the greatest threat our Party faces. We must have the resolve and tenacity to persevere in the never-ending fight against corruption. Only by intensifying efforts to address both the symptoms and root causes of corruption—by making sure that officials are honest, governmentis clean, and political affairs are handled with integrity—can we avoid history’s cycle of rise and fall and ensure the long-termstability of the Party and the country. Currently, the fight against corruption remains grave andcomplex; we must remainas firmas a rockin our resolve to build on the overwhelming momentum and secure a sweeping victory.We will continue to seethat there are no no-go zones, no ground is left unturned, and no tolerance is shown for corruption. We will impose tight constraints, maintain a tough stance and a long-term deterrence, punish both those who take bribes and those who offer them, and prevent interest groups from arising within the Party. We will institute a system of disciplinary inspection for city and county level Party committees in an intensified effort to address corruption that cxrcurs on the people’s doorsteps. Wherever offenders may flee, they will be brought back and brought to justice. We willwork for the adoption of national anti-corruption legislation and create a corruption reporting platform that covers both disciplinary inspection commissions and supervision agencies. 
We will strengthen deterrence so officials daren’t be corrupt, strengthen the cage of institutions so they’re unable to be corrupt, and strengthen their vigilance so that they have no desire to commit corruption. Our political environment will, through tireless efforts, like seas fallen calm and rivers running clear, be clean and free of corruption. 
（七）健全党和国家监督体系。 
Improving Party and state oversight systems
增强党自我净化能力，根本靠强化党的自我监督和群众监督。要加强对权力运行的制约和监督，让人民监督权力，让权力在阳光下运行，把权力关进制度的笼子。强化自上而下的组织监督，改进自下而上的民主监督，发挥同级相互监督作用，加强对党员领导干部的日常管理监督。深化政治巡视，坚持发现问题、形成震慑不动摇，建立巡视巡察上下联动的监督网。深化国家监察体制改革，将试点工作在全国推开，组建国家、省、市、县监察委员会，同党的纪律检查机关合署办公，实现对所有行使公权力的公职人员监察全覆盖。制定国家监察法，依法赋予监察委员会职责权限和调查手段，用留置取代 “两规”措施。改革审计管理体制，完善统计体制。构建党统一指挥、全面覆盖、权威高效的监督体系，把党内监督同国家机关监督、民主监督、司法监督、群众监督、舆论监督贯通起来，增强监督合力。 
To improve the Party’s ability to purify itself, it is essential that we strengthen Party self-supervision and subject ourselves to public oversight. We must strengthen checks on and oversight over the exercise of power, and ensure that power is exercised under public oversight, in broad daylight, and in an institutional cage. We will strengthen top-down organizational oversight, improve bottom-up democratic oversight, practice peer oversight, and tighten regular supervision over Party members in positions of leadership. We will intensify political inspection to identify problems and ensure that deterrence works; we will establish an oversight network that facilitates coordination in disciplinary inspections conducted at different levels. We will deepen reform of the national supervision system, conduct trials throughout the country, and establish supervisory commissions at the national, provincial, city, and county levels, which share offices and work together with the Party’s disciplinary inspection commissions. This will ensure that supervision covers everyone in the public sector who exercises public power. A national supervision law will be formulated. Supervisory commissions will be given responsibilities, powers, and means of investigation in accordance with law. The practice of shuanggui will be replaced by detention. We will reform the auditing management system and improve the statistics system. We will establish an authoritative, efficient oversight system with complete coverage under the Party’s unified command; and integrate intraparty oversight with oversight by state organs, democratic oversight, judicial oversight, public oversight, and oversight through public opinion. All this will create a powerful synergy for conducting oversight. 
（八）全面增强执政本领。 
Strengthening every dimension of our ability for governance 
领导十三亿多人的社会主义大国，我们党既要政治过硬，也要本领高强。 
To lead alarge socialist countryof more than 1.3 billion people, our Party must be both politically strong and highly competent. 
要增强学习本领，在全党营造善于学习、勇于实践的浓厚氛围，建设马克思主义学习型政党，推动建设学习大国。增强政治领导本领，坚持战略思维、创新思维、辩证思维、法治思维、底线思维，科学制定和坚决执行党的路线方针政策，把党总揽全局、协调各方落到实处。增强改革创新本领，保持锐意进取的精神风貌，善于结合实际创造性推动工作，善于运用互联网技术和信息化手段开展工作。增强科学发展本领，善于贯彻新发展理念，不断开创发展新局面。增强依法执政本领，加快形成覆盖党的领导和党的建设各方面的党内法规制度体系，加强和改善对国家政权机关的领导。增强群众工作本领，创新群众工作体制机制和方式方法，推动工会、共青团、妇联等群团组织增强政治性、先进性、群众性，发挥联系群众的桥梁纽带作用，组织动员广大人民群众坚定不移跟党走。增强狠抓落实本领，坚持说实话、谋实事、出实招、求实效，把雷厉风行和久久为功有机结合起来，勇于攻坚克难，以钉钉子精神做实做细做好各项工作。增强驾驭风险本领，健全各方面风险防控机制，善于处理各种复杂矛盾，勇于战胜前进道路上的各种艰难险阻，牢牢把握工作主动权。 
We should be good at learning. We will foster a strong atmosphere of learning and practicing in the Party, and build our Party into a Marxist learning party. We will nurture a love of learning in our people. We should be good at exercising political leadership. We should have strategic perspectives, develop creative thinking and a dialectical approach to thinking; we should think in terms of the rule of law, and think about worst-case scenarios. We should formulate sound Party lines, principles, and policies and resolutely implement them, ensuring that the Party exercises overall leadership and coordinates work in all areas. We should be good reformers and pioneers. We should be enterprising, work creatively in light of actual conditions,and adeptly apply information technology, including the internet, in our work. Weshould be good at promoting sound development. We should effectively put into practice the new development philosophy, and continue to break new ground in development. We should be good at exercising law-based governance. Wewill act more quickly to put in place a system of Party rules and regulations that covers all aspects of Party leadership and Party building, and strengthen and improve Party leadership over bodies of state power. 
We should be good at engaging with the people. We will develop new systems, mechanisms, ways, and means for this work. We will urge trade unions, Chinese Communist Youth League organizations, women’s federations, and other people’s organizations to strengthen their political consciousness, become more advanced, and better represent the people; to play their role as bridges linking the Party with the people; and to organize and motivate the people to follow the Party. We should be good at implementing policy. We should be open and frank, take effective measures to address real issues, and seek good outcomes. We should be ready both to act resolutely and swiftly and to make sustained efforts to tackle tough issues head-on. We should have the perseverance to hammer away until a taskis done, andmake concrete, meticulous, and effective efforts in all our work. We should be good at managing risks.We will improve risk prevention and control mechanisms in all areas, skillfully handle various complex issues, overcome all difficulties and obstacles that we meet on our way, and keep a firm hold on the initiative in our work.

同志们！ 
Comrades, 
中华民族是历经磨难、不屈不挠的伟大民族，中国人民是勤劳勇敢、自强不息的伟大人民，中国共产党是敢于斗争、敢于胜利的伟大政党。历史车轮滚滚向前，时代潮流浩浩荡荡。历史只会眷顾坚定者、奋进者、搏击者，而不会等待犹豫者、懈怠者、畏难者。全党一定要保持艰苦奋斗、戒骄戒躁的作风，以时不我待、只争朝夕的精神，奋力走好新时代的长征路。全党一定要自觉维护党的团结统一，保持党同人民群众的血肉联系，巩固全国各族人民大团结，加强海内外中华儿女大团结，团结一切可以团结的力量，齐心协力走向中华民族伟大复兴的光明前景。 
The Chinese nation is a great nation; it has been through hardships and adversity but remains indomitable. The Chinese people are a great people; they are industrious and brave; and they never pause in the pursuit of progress. The Communist Party of China is a great party; it has the courage to fight and the mettle to win. The wheels of history roll on; the tides of the times are vast and mighty. History looks kindly on those with resolve, with drive and ambition, and with plenty of guts; it won’t wait for the hesitant, the apathetic, or those shy of a challenge. All of us in the Party must work hard and live simply, guard against arrogance and impetuosity; and lose no time in progressing along the long march of the new era. We must conscientiously safeguard the solidarity and unity of the Party, maintain the Party’s deep bond with the people, and strengthen the great unity of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups and the great unity of all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation at home and abroad. Wemust unite all the forces that can be united and work as one to progress toward the brilliant future of national rejuvenation. 
青年兴则国家兴，青年强则国家强。青年一代有理想、有本领、有担当，国家就有前途，民族就有希望。中国梦是历史的、现实的，也是未来的；是我们这一代的，更是青年一代的。中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦终将在一代代青年的接力奋斗中变为现实。全党要关心和爱护青年，为他们实现人生出彩搭建舞台。广大青年要坚定理想信念，志存高远，脚踏实地，勇做时代的弄潮儿，在实现中国梦的生动实践中放飞青春梦想，在为人民利益的不懈奋斗中书写人生华章！ 
A nation will prosper only when its young people thrive; a country will be full of hope and have a great tomorrow only when its younger generations have ideals, ability, and a strong sense of responsibility. The Chinese Dream is a dream about history, the present, and the future. It is a dream of our generation, but even more so, a dream of the younger generations. The Chinese Dream of national rejuvenationwill be realizedultimately through the endeavors of young people, generation by generation. All of us in the Party should care about young people and set the stage for them to excel. To all our young people, you should have firm ideals and convictions, aim high, and have your feet firmly on the ground. You should ride the waves of your day; and in thecourse ofrealizingtheChinese Dream, fulfill your youthful dreams, and write a vivid chapter in your tireless endeavors to serve the interests of the people. 
大道之行，天下为公。站立在九百六十多万平方公里的广袤土地上，吸吮着五千多年中华民族漫长奋斗积累的文化养分，拥有十三亿多中国人民聚合的磅礴之力，我们走中国特色社会主义道路，具有无比广阔的时代舞台，具有无比深厚的历史底蕴，具有无比强大的前进定力。全党全国各族人民要紧密团结在党中央周围，高举中国特色社会主义伟大旗帜，锐意进取，埋头苦干，为实现推进现代化建设、完成祖国统一、维护世界和平与促进共同发展三大历史任务，为决胜全面建成小康社会、夺取新时代中国特色社会主义伟大胜利、实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦、实现人民对美好生活的向往继续奋斗！ 
A just cause should be pursued for the common good. Rooted in a land of more than 9.6 million square kilometers, nourished by a nation’s culture of more than 5,000 years, and backed by the invincible force of more than 1.3 billion people, we have an infinitely vast stage of our era, a historical heritage of unmatched depth, and incomparable resolve that enable us to forge ahead on the road of socialismwith Chinese characteristics. We, the entire Partyand the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, should rally closely around the Party Central Committee, and hold high the banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should keep on working with great determination to accomplish the three historic tasks of advancing modernization, realizing China’s reunification,and preserving world peace and promoting common development; we should secure a decisive victoryin finishing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, strive for the great success of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation, and see that our people realize their aspirations for a better life.
